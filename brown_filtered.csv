"Fads , facts"
Not all the concern for health is well directed .
And fats .
Out of cholesterol come Keys's main messages so far :
Americans eat too much .
Americans eat too much fat .
Obesity : a malnutrition .
He is particularly vulnerable to diabetes .
Physical exercise raises the appestat .
So does cold weather .
Food for frustration .
That remarkable cholesterol .
They know it is the chief ingredient in gallstones .
Fats & coronaries .
But fatty foods do .
Saturated fats can accommodate no more hydrogens .
We marvel at their blindness for not seeing this .
Even Mr. Miller himself seems uncertain on this score .
And his belief is not to his discredit .
( page 34 )
Spirit and community
Surely this is a reality we all acknowledge .
But this statement is completely unconvincing .
) Tillich as well .
A second point requires more extended comment .
Nowhere have I seen public expression of anti-Catholicism .
Some Catholic priests lecture there ; ;
But how can one figure symbolize both ? ?
for a spiral has motion as well as recurrence .
yet each historical event remains unique .
Christ is both unique and universal .
"They were , in fact , children ."
Historical existence is a created good .
in the similitude of God he created him '' .
Therefore Irenaeus describes man's creation as follows :
`` Eve was disobedient ; ;
At the nadir of that circuit is death .
and disobedience to God entails death .
The wages of sin is death .
This applies to his picture of Adam .
Parker was never excommunicated .
Channing wrote this -- in a letter ! !
Reproach the Catholics for it ! !

Parker meant business .
Are you longing for peace in your heart ? ?
Such a calm and assuring peace can be yours .

So it is spiritually .
Why ? ?
Only He can satisfy the deepest longings .
whom shall I fear ? ?
The Lord is the strength of my life ; ;

( Psalm 27 : 1 )
They are ' worry warts .
It must be getting more serious .
People are giving their doctors a hard time .
What is the real cause of them ? ?
And that's worse than sad .
Maybe we are talking about them too much .
It could have the same effect on Communists .
whom shall I fear ? ?
The Lord is the strength of my life ; ;
of whom shall I be afraid '' ? ?
No ? ?
Our enemy is also threatening to devour us .

Preparation for membership
1 )
A helpful leaflet may be enclosed in the letter .
2 )
This is not a social call .
It is definitely a `` spiritual guidance conference '' .
Each conference should be concluded naturally with prayer .
3 )
Some churches require more .
None should ask less .
The sessions should cover four major areas : A
-- The Christian Faith ; ;
B
-- History of the Church ; ;
C
-- Duties of Church Membership ; ;
D
-- The Local Church and Its Program
.
Fourth session important
( See sample on pp. 78-79 .
Additional suggestions for membership preparation
The following have been found effective .
1 )
Extend the number of classes .
This gives greater opportunity for the learning process .
2 )
3 )
Use audio-visual aids .
4 )
Have a `` Question Box '' .
Some new members will hesitate to ask questions audibly .
5 )
Use a textbook with assigned readings each week .
6 )
7 )
"Conduct examinations , using a true-false check sheet ."
8 )
9 )
Assign a series of catechism questions to be memorized .
10 )
11 )
What about transfers ? ?
People appreciate experiences that demand something of them .
Reception into the Church Fellowship
1 )
Provide a name card for each new member .
Outline plans for the entire service .
2 )
Sponsors may sit with them also .
3 )
4 )
Give each new member a certificate of membership .
5 )
6 )
Lead the congregation in a response of welcome .
7 )
8 )
9 )
the church is `` the family of God '' .
This is no spectator-type experience ; ;
everyone is to be a participant .
"Yet during the same period there were 1,080,062 additions ."
"Still another denomination had 7,360,187 members twenty years ago ."
Something is wrong when these things happen .
Basic needs
"new members can become participating , growing members ."
It must be planned and carefully developed .
-- Welcome into the fellowship
-- Sincere Christian love and understanding
-- Inspiring and challenging worship experiences
-- Social and recreational activities
-- Opportunities for Christian service
-- Creative prayer experiences
-- Guidance in Christian social concerns .
Men need unity and they need God .
It lies in institutions .
The suggestion is naive .
Is there any way out of the predicament ? ?
"Approached creatively , it is a high art ."
1 )
Such needs may rise to pathological proportions .
2 )
But the problem extends elsewhere .
3 )
I turn finally to several theological developments .
1 .
Theocracy reconsidered .
Comparable trends can be noted elsewhere .
2 .
Salvation reconsidered .
Would such an act of refusal be useful ? ?
it is to stride along the steep slope downward .
A narrow professionalism
There is some reality to this ; ;
`` Against the grain of creation ''
( This has not been the case everywhere .
)
A fragmented Society
We may feel pessimistic at the outlook .
Atomic energy
Hydrogen is just as plentiful as uranium is scarce .
We know that we have hydrogen in water ; ;
An octillion atoms
Now let us see where this power comes from .
Pennsylvania thus blanketed would contain about a quintillion peas .
But we still have a long way to go .
then we have sextillion peas .
and then we have septillion .
"we get 250,000 planets ; ;"
A speck -- and space
"This is the atomic sun , the atomic nucleus ."
Music of the spheres
Then came the scientific revolution in the late 1920's .
the rest is obtained from harbor scallops .
At best only an approximation could be arrived at .
To generalize for the entire nation would be absurd .
Yet this cannot be proved .
The American dream
The American dream was compounded of many strains .
Reform movements
Others were ephemeral .
Some disappeared with the attainment of their purpose .
The anti-slavery movement
The anti-slavery movement took many forms .
Theodore Dwight Weld ( 1803-1895 ) was especially active .
The majority then went to the infant Oberlin .
But this eminence was not without its weighty responsibilities .
The self-realized Mahayana saint possessed superhuman powers and magic .

The need of the new birth
St. John 3 : 7 .
The new birth is necessary because god is holy .
"1 , St. Peter 15 , 16 ."
Holiness without which no man will see God .
Hebrews 14 .
The new birth is necessary because all have sinned .
there is none who understands ; ;
there is none who seeks after God .
All have gone astray together ; ;
"Romans 3 : 10-12 , 23 ."
Romans 12 .
Ephesians 2 : 1 .
"2 , Corinthians 4 : 3 , 4 ."
Ephesians 10 .
The new birth is effected through the word of God
.
1 St. Peter 23 .
St. James 18 .
"St. John 3 : 5 , 6 ."
Evidences of the new birth
1 St. John 5 : 1 .
As many as received him were born of God .
"St. John 12 , 13 ."
Cf. 1 St. John 2 : 1 ) .
1 St. John 3 : 9 .
1 St. John 18 .
1 St. John 29 .
If we are born of God we love God .
1 St. John 4 : 7 .
He who does not love abides in death .

1 St. John 5 : 4 .
2 St. Peter 18 .
Philippians 1 : 6 .

The nature of the new birth
the new birth is a new creation .
Galatians 15 .
"behold , they are made new ! !"
2 Corinthians 17 .
Ephesians 2 : 8-10 .
I came that they may have life .
St. John 10 .
He who has the Son has the life .
1 St. John 12 .
St. John 36 .
2 St. Peter 1 : 4 .
"Christ in you , your hope of glory ."
Colossians 27 .
Galatians 20 .
To have Christ dwelling through faith in your hearts .
Ephesians 17 .
The new birth is miraculous and mysterious .
So is everyone who is born of the Spirit .
St. John 3 : 8 .
The new birth is immediate and instantaneous .
St. John 24 .
The means of the new birth
the new birth is a work of god .
"St. John 12 , 13 ."
A final word
You cannot be saved ; ;
You may do as you please with God now .
It is permitted .
He was then in man's hands .
They cursed Him .
It was permitted .
Men spit on Him .
God allowed it .
They called Him a devil .
God withheld His wrath .
and God allowed it .
You can ignore Him .
It is permitted .
It is permitted .
He is in your hands -- now .

I cannot define it fully .
sometimes not .

And the stories they told were true .
That was nearly 13 years ago .

Nothing is easier to grow from seed than pansies .
Pansies don't have to be coddled ; ;
Then I cover the sowing with a board .
"I like sawdust for this , or hay ."
Pansies are gluttons .
I doubt if it is possible to overfeed them .
I spade lots of compost into their bed ; ;
They need mulch .
We put a light mulch over the seedlings ; ;
now we must use a heavy one .
When winter comes be ready with additional mulch .
That cold frame was my morale builder ; ;
in fact it is easier .
That is not true .
Would you like to grow exhibition pansies ? ?

Hot rodding is a science .
This changes the formula to an `` equation '' .
Equations for rodding formulas are not complicated .
.
The symbol for multiplication is `` **b '' .
For example : Af .
The symbol for subtraction is the standard minus sign .
This is nothing more than a dash .
It separates two or more numbers .
For example : Af .
Addition is indicated by the + symbol .
For example : Af .
This part of the equation would then become 4 .
Charts for this purpose are available from many sources .
Some formulas contain `` constants '' .
Rodding formulas apply to many phases of the sport .
"However , some formulas are used more than others ."

Preserving life and limb
"Soignee pools , alas , do not just happen ."
Preserving the pool
You need more chlorine .
The walls feel slippery .
You need algaecide .
A pool is no place for a shut trap .
"When shed , they leave rust marks ."
It has happened .

You may find a conditioner rated by horsepower .
Here's why :
Reducing humidity is often as important as cooling .
Money-saving tips .
They're easier to shade there .
Gas adds to the moisture load .
"Insulate , weatherstrip , double-glaze to the maximum ."
"In insulation , the numbers to remember are 6-4-2 ."
Keeping conditioners quiet .
Avoid attic placement directly above a bedroom .
This is particularly true in site selection .
How much study is required ? ?
You need answers to four important questions .
What are the existing recreation features ? ?
How well can the site be developed ? ?
How useful will it be to the public ? ?
Is this site available ? ?
Quality is vitally important .
The quantity of water flow may be critical ; ;
Check the quality of the water .
How well can the site be developed ? ?
Many things need to be checked :
size and shape
Adjoining areas
Topography
-- Topography is very important .
Water
Plants
-- The existing plant growth calls for thorough checking .
The extent and location of open areas is noted .

Problems in the market
greater price-consciousness .
there is every indication it will continue .
Increased customer sophistication .
Greater demand for services .
There are two reasons for this .
"First , most products tend to become more complex ."
Wider discretionary choices for customers .

Insect bites were cured in many ways .
Many an old-timer swore by the saliva method ; ;
This was used also for bruises .
Ant bites were eased by applying liquid bluing .
mud was sometimes used as well as soap .
Bedbugs were a common pest in pioneer days ; ;
At times pioneer children got lice in their hair .
Boils have always been a source of much trouble .
This was also used for sores .

Many of the new appointees are art collectors .
McNamara is the scholar-businessman .

The list goes on .
Two men show promise of playing prominent roles :
"Nonetheless , they found common interests ."

He is not likely to win this battle easily .
eleven others were introduced .
Mrs. Kennedy shows a determination to change all this .
It now serves the President in his oval office .
She traced it to a storage room .
A curator has been appointed .
Kennedy made a midnight inspection of the Square .
The situation involved some political perils .

Uncle John Vinnicum Morse was the immediate popular suspect .
He said he would have convicted `` somebody '' .
These officers found no incriminating information .
Morse's alibi was not as solid as it seemed .
Fall River is not a fashionable town .
The dinner hour there was twelve noon .
He met nobody he knew on this walk .
Bridget's testimony was in direct contradiction .
This was long after Morse had left the house .
The motive may have been the mysterious quarrel ; ;
He wrote :
Neither had any interest in the deaths ; ;
"Lizzie , actually , never named any suspect ."
They have not been friendly for years '' .
"Asked who this was , she named Harrington ."
Her statement certainly was true ; ;
He said he had not heard of anybody else .
`` How about Bridget Sullivan '' ? ?
I inquired .
There are also other factors that require closer examination .
The death of her mother in 1865 prevented this .
'' And that she proceeded to do .
Mathematics came next '' .
Her study of history was persistently pursued .

Lecky and Stanley's Eastern Church .
She played chess with him by postcard .
There was another family interest also .
Lucy was a lively part of the household .
Here was a cause she believed in .
of her `` great power of discernment '' ; ;
and her close knowledge of individual students .
Both had eager and inquiring minds ; ;
Yet they thrived on it .
and that the year's work had gone forward smoothly .
Rockefeller and Packard Halls had been renovated ; ;
walks laid ; ;
and ground had been broken for the superintendent's home .
Now the school was indeed bereft .
She remained in Atlanta through June and July ; ;
she died on August sixth .
But she decided to stay at Spelman .
Soon the office work claimed all her time .
He receives remuneration for his work .
Rather we see here another vicious circle .
How can the vicious circle be broken ? ?
Vocational education
Two stories will illustrate what I have in mind .
I asked .

They are used mainly for their oil .
Some are used in paints along with drying oils .

A cow rose from the ground rear end first .
Colors of cattle came in for their special names .

It was John who found the lion tracks .
Kearton focussed his field glasses .
The dogs were working a trail -- lion ? ?
Hyena ? ?
"`` Not yet '' , cautioned Ulyate ."
`` Light it '' ! !
Two quick shots sounded .
Then the heavy roar of a lion .
"Why she doesn't charge him , I don't know ."
And he hasn't even got a knife on him .
"Careful , don't disturb her '' ."
He threw the lasso .
But now she sank lower to the rock .
Her roar changed to a growl .
Her tail no longer lashed .
She was rested and could mount a charge .
"Jones yelled , `` or she'll kill 'em all ."
Bring me the firecrackers '' .
"`` Ain't she a beauty , though '' ? ?"
Called out Means as she ran .
It was hot .
The dogs were tired .
The men were tired too .
And the sun was beginning to go down .
If dark came they would lose her .
"Loveless , too , objected ."
"`` It won't work , Colonel '' ."
`` Just the same we'll try it '' .
She had chosen the spot well .
"`` Careful , now '' , Jones warned ."
Means tried her first .
Means edged closer .
She snarled warningly .
Means spit and edged on .
"Again she snarled , and again he edged ."
The pony was sidewise to her .
She charged .
Means spun and spurred .
For thirty yards she gained rapidly .
Means held steady one jump ahead of her .
Then gradually he began to pull away .
How much head start ? ?
No one knew exactly .
That was the whole question .
"Enough , was the answer ."
Tossing his rope and shouting he attracted her attention .
From behind her Means shot forward at a run .
But Means kept on .
The ecumenical congregation
This way of describing the matter is unfortunate .
It implies two misconceptions .
It is hardly possible to emphasize this too much .
The local and the ecumenical are one .
Neither is adequate if it stands alone .
And this is what all too often happens .
Divergent perspectives
They were bifocals .
It is eminently successful according to all conventional standards .
It is growing in numbers .
Its people are agreeable friends .
It has a beautiful edifice .
It provides pastoral care for the sick and troubled .

None of this is true for the Northerner .

I find this view amazing .
The answer to both questions is immediately obvious .

Narrative time and film time
So is the time of the novel .
The time of the motion picture is fixed absolutely .
This is the rate of projection ; ;
it is also the rate of photographing .
The Great Train Robbery is a one-reel film .
He did more than that .

Each has its peculiar style .
"Where his predecessors had glowered , Menshikov smiled ."
Overnight he became the most available man in Washington .
His English was usable and he used it fearlessly .
`` But bring it right back .

`` Readiness exercises '' are almost continuous .

They know little about their machinery beyond mechanical details .
These men are not callous .
It is their job to think about the unthinkable .
Alternate locations exist for all key command centers .
That's the law .
But what if somebody decides to break it ? ?
He makes the momentous decision .
Nobody can be absolutely certain of the answers .
All could help the President make his decision .

His eyes are steady anchors of the deepest brown .
No question ruffles him or causes him to hesitate .

The answer is a cryptographic secret .
Their heads were in the air sniffing .
A white man would not have seen it .
They were chasing a rain cloud .
"The games were over , this was life ."
Sometimes it was to skirt a gulley .
Their gait is impossible to convey in words .
It is a barely controlled skimming of the ground .
They ran for three hours .

The rancher was navigating his way across the flatland .
`` Do you always navigate like this '' ? ?
I asked .
"`` Damned right '' , he said ."
Very simple '' .
He was right .
The landscape kept repeating itself .
Finally we approached the bivouac of the aborigines .
"There was also a dog , a dingo dog ."
No one patted the dog .
It was not a pet .
It was a worker .
The man was leaning against the rock .
He gazed away from us as we approached .
He was over six feet tall and very thin .
His legs were narrow and very long .
He had long black hair and a wispy beard .
I turned to look at the lubra .
"like the man , she was entirely naked ."
"There was also a boomerang , elaborately carved ."
The smell at first was more surprising than unpleasant .
But that is a cliche and a dishonest one .
The Australian asked .

Idje still stared over our shoulders at the horizon .

Did he come from a musical family ? ?
When he was eight he began violin lessons .
His professional career began when he was twenty ; ;
"Yes , the Maestro assented ."
Had he always wished to be a conductor ? ?
In 1945 he became conductor of the Buffalo Philharmonic .
Where in Europe was he going now ? ?
And how did he feel about modern art ? ?
What did he do for relaxation ? ?
He cited Heine and Stendhal as favorites in literature .
"I was chairman , the only not youthful participant ."
We would like to do that too '' .
One girl expressed what was obviously in their minds .

In 1900 the South was only 15% urban ; ;
in 1950 it had become 47.1% urban .
"the list is , obviously , endless ."
But these sources have not been tapped .
such are simply not within his bounded province .
Where are the writers to treat these changes ? ?
A new order is thrusting itself into being .
It bewilders and befuddles him .
"He treats it with a mythological , universal application ."
The concept remains subjective .
Others look to more objective devices of order .
The system works as an impersonal mechanism .
"Again , the composer must select his own materials ."
Even the least alteration will change the quality .
This became a dance called Prelude To Flight .
But the metamorphosis must come first .

Events occur without apparent reason .
He may toss coins ; ;
Each performance may be different .

One wonders about its applicability to people .
"The answer is , of course , yes ."
We have ample light when the sun sets ; ;
the range of our voice ignores distance .
At what stage are social sciences then ? ?

Perhaps things were even worse then .
They include both individual fears and collective ones .
There is still the remote possibility of planetoid collision .
A meteor could fall on San Francisco .

"Nothing like Godot , he arrived before the hour ."

American newspaper reviewers like to call his plays nihilistic .
They find deep pessimism in them .
Nevertheless I was curious .
Beckett's appearance is rough-hewn Irish .
One might say it combines the man ; ;
own pride and humility .
The mouth frequently breaks into a disarming smile .
His tweed suit was a baggy gray and green .
`` The confusion is not my invention .
`` What is more true than anything else ? ?
One is not more true than the other .
I am not a philosopher .
It has held them at bay .
And why not ? ?
Beckett's own work is an example .
The form and the chaos remain separate .
The latter is not reduced to the former .
Isn't all art ambiguous ? ?
`` Not this .
This is clear .
This does not allow the mystery to invade us .
"With classical art , all is settled ."
But it is different at Chartres .
`` Yes .
How can we make sense of this division ? ?
"In classical drama , such problems do not arise ."
"As she goes , she herself will be illuminated ."
That is the play .
"`` Well , really there is none at all ."
I have no religious feeling .
Once I had a religious emotion .
It was at my first Communion .
No more .
My mother was deeply religious .
So was my brother .
My father had none .
"`` Yes , for they deal with distress ."
Some people object to this in my writing .
As if it were perverse to do so ! !
Then he thought me more perverse than ever .
One does not have to look for distress .
`` Perhaps '' stands in place of commitment .

"`` All is not sex '' , declared Lawrence ."
But for the beat generation all is sex .

Boredom is death .
Who are the creative representatives of this movement ? ?
What one actually remembers is its greenness .

The New England conscience became desensitized .

Few writers have better understood their deepest selves .
Heidenstam could never be satisfied by surface .

All his people ask for is no more war .
He had become king at fifteen .
These are suggestive of Selma Lagerlof .
The record teems with romance and adventure .
He is an individualist but not an anarchist ; ;

The private eye is therefore a moral man ; ;

"Unfortunately , this assumption does not always hold good ."
Sherlock Holmes is not merely an individualist ; ;
he is very close to being a mental case .
His eccentricity begins as a defense against boredom .

Poirot and his counterparts are perfectly respectable people ; ;
it is true that they are also extremely dull .
His alienation is far more acute than Holmes' ; ;

There were no reasons for such suppositions then .
Now what is perfect motion ? ?
"It must , apparently , be motion without termini ."
It is never motion towards something .
Their motion will be eternal and perfect .
Copernicus' achievement was to have invented systematic astronomy .
This is a mistake .
Without careful qualification this can be misleading .
The latter required juggling several elements simultaneously .
But ' simplicity ' here refers to systematic simplicity .
It is an organized system of these things .
It provides exactly the same reason .
It is really the funeral day of scholastic science .
In what does the dissatisfaction of Copernicus-the-astronomer consist ? ?
What in The Almagest draws his fire ? ?
Geocentricism per se ? ?
No .
"Copernicus required a systematically integrated , physically intelligible astronomy ."
The latter looked backward upon inherited deficiencies .
His feeling always exacted sacrifices from her .

One needs high talent .
Segovia has written about Carl :
Nor does Carl reject this identity .
Carl hadn't brought his along .
Well you can pose inside .

This has always been Carl's attitude .
When fame came it changed Sandburg only slightly .
"That was all he said , Lewis reports ."
That was all he had to say .

the readiness to sacrifice for worthwhile causes ; ;
the courage to meet every challenge ; ;
"Otherwise , the outlook could be dark indeed ."
America possesses an enormous defense power .

I don't know .
Of course the matter caught the public's attention .
Hammarskjold didn't like the way it was carried out .
It was a sort of Gotterdammerung affair .
''
Peter Marshall reflected .
Could you comment on that '' ? ?
Marshall asked .
`` Those '' ! !
Gross answered .
Gross pointed to the Manley story .
That implies that Shann was on the enemy side .
You see what I mean ? ?
How it's phrased there -- the word violent .
But it wasn't a violent discussion .
Bang-Jensen was in `` hysterical condition '' .
)
"Gross stopped briefly , then went on ."
`` Shann was responsible for the report .
He has felt terrible about all this .
"`` You know , this hits in many areas ."
Chapter 22
It said in part :
`` This reveals some misunderstanding on your part .
''
"There , Ernest Gross further assured him :"
Fortunately the hole was found at last and plugged .
The only lasting difficulty was the food .
Skipping was the alternative .
This is very uncommon '' .
She was now enjoying the voyage very much .

There was one particular word that troubled his conscience .
even Christ was baptized by this method .
Ann was very troubled .
but I hear the thunder roll ; ;
see the lightning flash ; ;
and yet remain unmoved '' .
Ann was plainly disappointed in his appearance .
The pilot possessed excellent skill at his calling ; ;
Harriet was just as delighted .
Where were the hardships she had expected ? ?
The noise stunned her .

After that Salem ships decided to bypass unfriendly Burma .
They despised foreigners .

Certainly it is the most pretentious and elaborate .
Their first collaboration came close .
But one afternoon Mrs. Mercer met her ; ;
But Mrs. Mercer demanded more .
There they stayed '' .
He has also an extraordinary conscience .
While with the Whiteman band Mercer met Jerry Arlen .
He has a wonderfully retentive memory .
He is probably our most original composer ; ;
I feel obliged to describe this cubbyhole .
Robbie was a war veteran with battle-shattered knees .
Mr. Herford's appearance was that of a frustrated gnome .
He waited a long time .
"Nothing was said , nothing accomplished ."
-- to go to the door .
Mr. Herford touched the fat man's arm .
"`` Pardon me , sir ."
I had had difficulties from the very first day .
Nor were his manners barbaric .
Why ' '' ? ?
It's bigger than the Armistice '' .
It's bigger than the Armistice '' .
I shall tell of it later on .
"Mr. Baer had an auburn beard , like Longfellow's ."
"`` Where to , sir '' ? ?"
and also to change telephones .
He had a somewhat goggle-eyed expression .
He had been `` seeing things '' .
I cannot ''
Watson showed this wire to Colonel Van Hamm .
`` Don't bother to look any further .
Dr. Menas S. Gregory was another .
He brought her shawls .
He got her dozens of them .
She kept the dolls on the Lincoln bed .
It had a tiny envelope tied to its wrist .
The name inside the envelope was `` Cynthia '' .
John was away at school most of the time .
One White House dog was immortalized in a painting .
This is not true .
There is a long train flowing from the shoulders .
Rob Roy remained boss of all the dogs .
Mrs. Coolidge chose Mama in her place .
It was a high mark for Mama .
He knew exactly how to be colorful ! !
You can imagine that he got pretty good service .
One person she helped was my brother .
they have observed correct neutrality ; ;
they have been someone's enemy .
"Diversity of perception , yes ; ;"
"diversity of fact , yes ."
predispositions regarding intelligence .
But General Grant may have been self-victimized .
These are personality factors ; ;
Many selections are themselves convincing contributions to this appraisal .
What shall these effects be ? ?
What is the probable course of future developments ? ?
Social process is always anchored in past predisposition ; ;
the process can be accelerated .
But simple involvement is not enough ; ;
One would need to test this proposition carefully ; ;
"Scientists often turn out to be idiosyncratic , too ."
"But still , the proposition is worth examination ."
I do not know that this is true ; ;
Feeling useless seems generally to be an unpleasant sensation .
Let us differentiate a few of these ideas .
Such study may take many forms .
He will frequently return to it .
He may also consider ideas .
It is through such reflection that literature approaches philosophy .
Our understanding will very probably require both these commentaries .
The actual moments of contact are vitally important .
Here an important caveat is in order .
''
"The Congressman tried hard , but failed ."
Hatred tied his hands in Congress .
He was the House pariah .
Even the regular Democrats disowned him .
Some preferred Judge Alton B. Parker of New York .
There was a host of dark horses .
His candidacy affected his journalism somewhat .
But his increasing strength in the West looked menacing .
But there is a Hearst barrel .
''
`` There's nothing like buildin' from the bottom up .
The Hearst dollar mark is all over them .
''
`` I must hurry to catch my train '' .
`` Don't bother .
2 .
The Hearst `` barrel ''
I supported Cleveland three times and Bryan twice .
"Characteristically , Trevelyan enjoyed writing the work ."
And Grey's Northumberland background was close to Trevelyan's own .
For once his touch deserted him .
His technique is genuinely masterful .
The result was fortunate .
Trevelyan's excursions into contemporary history were rarely happy ones .
The strength of the History is also its weakness .
`` May we come with you '' ? ?
Called out a dozen young voices .
That was all they needed .
They would champion me .
The real Franco-German frontier was beyond the town's limits .
`` I thank you most heartily for being here .
I ask you all to support me in this .
I have full confidence in you .
"Now , let's go '' ."
"As usual , the press photographers were on hand ."
I took one step eastward .
`` Is this then the frontier '' ? ?
I asked him .
`` Yes '' .
The waspish man stepped forward .
`` Line ? ?
Line ? ?
I mean ''
`` No line '' ? ?
I asked .
I have witnesses .
Now I learn I cannot enter Germany .
`` Oh ? ?
`` Visa ? ?
But there is no question of a visa .
You are still in France '' .
The Interior man looked uneasily at his French compatriot .
`` There must be a line '' ! !
"And `` Bravo , Garry , continue '' ! !"
Asked a young mustached Frenchman .
`` It will be very cold '' .
Her name was Esther Peter .
`` Who is it '' ? ?
May we have a word with you '' ? ?
`` I'm sorry .
I heard nothing more .
He advised immediate hospitalization .
Esther looked at me .
I looked from her to him .
`` What is your name '' ? ?
I asked him .
`` Jean Babel '' .
"`` Shake '' , I said ."
`` I am so happy .
"Now come , Garry , we must go quickly ."
There is a police car outside .
Maybe they will take us '' .
He never knew how he got there .
Eight field guns were captured in position .
Sherman laid great store by place captures .
Proposals were in the air for a year's armistice .
Lincoln was sure that he would not be re-elected .
Official congratulations showered upon Sherman and his army .
"Lincoln mentioned their distinguished ability , courage and perseverance ."
"Grant called it prompt , skillful and brilliant ."
Actually the Atlanta campaign was a military failure .
The skirmishing was almost constant .
The horseman required eleven times more than the footman .
So Sherman tried a compromise .
It failed to work .
This letter concluded with an invitation : ``
Mr. Meynell knows the way .
"Ever yours sincerely ,"
I wish you would return them to her .
I have not the heart .
and now ! !
What has it all come to ? ?
All chance of fulfilling my destiny is over .
For them a box will be lodgment enough .
Katie cannot mind your seeing them now ; ;
"If otherwise , you will give me a pleasure ."
O Wilfrid ! !
It is strange ; ;
Meynell's remedy for Thompson's despondent mood was typically practical .
"3 ,"
The Marshal came to know Littlepage quite well .
Then there were the distinguished foreign volunteers .
From America were the Messrs. Littlepage and Jones .
'' So of course he stayed put .
Filigreed perfume boxes exuded the aromas of Araby .
He had collared one of his generals in public .
"When this happened , everything stopped ."
He was ugly .
Age ? ?
Mission ? ?
Current status ? ?
Woe betide the interviewee if he answered vaguely .
Suvorov's contempt for don't-know's was proverbial ; ;
His breakfast was tea ; ;
his dinner fell anywhere from nine to noon ; ;
his supper was nothing .
Passing dogs were greeted with a cordial bark .
He had also mastered the Cossack tongue .
He always kept a few on his personal staff .
broad red stripes down the trouser leg ; ;
The little official hung his head in shame .
The doctor gravely nodded approval .
It was funny but it was also touching .
They are longing to see you '' .
My diplomacy was needless .
Will it live up to its reputation ? ?
And then perhaps one day we get to Athens .
We are here ! !
It had better be good .
Don't worry about the Acropolis .
It is awe-inspiring .
The light at that time is a benediction .
Nearby is the temple of Athena .
Furthermore I can identify each design .
The columns of the Parthenon are fluted Doric .
It was very stimulating .
They close sometime after eight .
One is Greece is not yet suffering from overpopulation .
The public may still find pleasure in public places .
Later they would be hoisted into place .
I think its thirst had never been assuaged before .
But this one was .
The strategy worked perfectly .
The anonymous correspondent did not resort to innuendoes .
He called Pike a thief .
Robinson did neither .
Woodruff's strategy had been immensely successful .
"Besides being political allies , they were also friends ."
Woodruff was furious .
Then he called on the governor to explain why .
"As a consequence , he did neither ."

; ;
"`` Little Rock is a vile , detestable place ."
'' He wrote .
He said Gorton was a holy man ; ;
Gorton and his family moved to Plymouth .
The report was : ``
He was jailed and banished .
Roger Williams wrote his friend Winthrop as follows : ``
The settlement was called Shawomet .
Instead of that he was engulfed by bedlam .
Then Massachusetts switched to its standard tactics .
Governor Winthrop wrote : ``
On Sunday they refused to attend church .
The magistrates were determined to compel them .
Gorton replied with blasts that scandalized the congregation .
2 .
3 .
4 .
Gorton answered in writing .
The three others got off easier .
Papa was still elated over his afternoon visit downtown .
The hemorrhage was in the prostate region ; ;
Dr. Glenn saw at once what had happened .
`` It'll take a lot to replace it '' .
Let me give Papa blood '' .
They made the tests and came to Fred ; ;
Fred demanded .
"`` Why can't I , Doctor '' ? ?"
It's too late now .
He's past helping .
He's as good as gone '' .
And in a few minutes Papa was dead .
It was well past midnight .
"The date was June 20 , 1922 ."
A biographical sketch followed .
The burial was out in Riverside Cemetery .
And that's how Papa's estate was divided .
"But he had succeeded well , we agreed ."
For years Papa and Mama had been large taxpayers .
I recall that several years their taxes exceeded $800 .
"`` Merciful God , Julia '' ! !"
But he never expected to do that .
"And he didn't , by a long shot ! !"
35 .
"In fact , he didn't want to teach anywhere ."
And that's what he did .
That third year he wrote plays with a fury .
I think I'm right in that figure .
It ran until past one o'clock .
That was Tom's weakness ; ;
"he wanted nothing compressed , tight ."
"he despised parsimony , and particularly of words ."
I engaged more and more in religious activities .
I went to an afternoon service at the Aj .
Meanwhile I myself was not yet saved .
"Finally , after years , I gave up ."
This doctrine was repugnant to my moral sense .
There was one further step in my religious progress .
"If obeyed , the law brings order and satisfaction ."
"If disobeyed , the result is turmoil and chaos ."
We can conceive of no alternatives .
Their basis seems deeper than mere authority .
Deity and Law are one and inseparable .
No one is to judge others '' .
For this decision a man must take personal responsibility .
Perhaps it should have .
My own experience has followed simpler lines .
Religion thus becomes integrated with life .
Such is the field for exercising our reverence .
Let us now give some thought to the soul .
I asked one day what he was doing .
This was a profound statement .
Wonder grows .
It is endless .
His inability to wonder vitiates his argument .
Plato and Aristotle
Plato and Aristotle agree on some vital literary issues .
only the philosopher knows the truth .
"Poets , moreover , dwell on human passions ."
He says : ``
Gosson and Sidney
Many students of literature know that classical defense .
The same patterned consistency shows itself in occupational choices .
"They also want money , prestige , and security ."
The purely cognitive or informational problems are often acute .
But these terms are treacherous .
But the correlation is substantial only among upperclassmen .
"In this sense also , they are surely conformists ."
But the extent of ethical robotism is easily overestimated .
The `` cult of adjustment '' does exist .
Morgan himself had sciatica again .
Similar orders were given to the Maryland militia .
The redcoats ran like rabbits .
"Also , he was now forty-three years old ."
These were Oneida Indians .
This was Boniface's monumental tactlessness .
And yet he made no pretense about it ; ;
This was a doubly bitter blow to the king .
It was a very tempting offer .
Time went on and everybody got older .
They were like two strangers .
Tessie could do nothing for Alfred .
She couldn't cook or clean or make him comfortable .
"Alfred knew that , too ."
He knew Alfred liked me ; ;
The doctor wanted him in a hospital ; ;
the nearest one was forty miles away in Kingston .
Meltzer knew why I had come for him .
For a few minutes there was nothing to hear .
Alfred was dressed for his trip to the hospital .
The car was waiting for him .
She didn't turn away from the window .
Alfred looked straight ahead .
Alfred ! !
Speak to me '' .
12 `` where is it written '' ? ?
Meltzer was a boarder with the Banks family .
Lilly Banks and I became friends .
I helped Lilly in the store .
"When the work was finished , we would walk ."
Lilly preferred the loneliness of that walk .
It wasn't hard to understand .
To me Lilly was a fine and lovely girl .
This is nevertheless a minority view .
Even earlier Haverfield had come to the same conclusion .
What exactly are we trying to prove ? ?
"it meant instead hardship , dirt , and death ."
from the General's idea a chain reaction occurred .
It was 258 .
The existing Army posts were wholly inadequate .
It was a gargantuan task ; ;
It was the influenza pandemic of 1918-19 .
"in the United States 300,000 succumbed to it ."
Baker moved first ; ;
This was the negative side of the situation .
But we abide by their insight .
It is after the late seventeenth century .
"But it is true , nevertheless ."
the Weird Sisters wait for the soul of Macbeth .
"In tragedy , lightning is a messenger ."
It banishes the night wanderers to fire or repose .
Tragedy presumes such a configuration .
In La Nouvelle-Heloise and Werther tragedy is made intimate .
But one major fact seems undeniable .
"They are Descartes , Newton , and Voltaire ."
It could not really be fulfilled .
Goethe used the fable to more elaborate ends .
my mare at coming up 14 days ; ;
Here was another indispensable tool .
All of Adams' work reflects this dogmatic characteristic .
Religion without supernaturalism
But it was nothing more than that .
He did not deny God ; ;
Doctrine was not only mysterious ; ;
Victor had led an adventurous life .
Then he began to have epileptic fits .
Of course it was not meant to be .
People and books are enough for them '' .
And that was the end .
Or nearly .
He went to the Hotel Mayflower and telegraphed Mencken .
But not for long .
But none of this could soothe the exacerbated nerves .

Blackman had brought news from Kansas City .
Lewis himself furthered these tales .
He evidently earned the place assigned him .
Recapitulation of Milton's undergraduate career
His other activities are not so easily recovered .
"A quibusdam , , audivi nuper Domina ."
"Under their rule , earth becomes a technological utopia ."
Stigmata quite sufficient for diagnosis are nevertheless there .
Similarly the optimism of age protests too much .
But at least the question has been raised .
I have changed and I have reversed opinions ; ;
With this excuse I have never been much impressed .
And I suppose it did .
I know that one must act .
`` How on earth do you manage it ? ?
What is the trick '' ? ?
there is no trick involved .
Cynical ? ?
Blasphemous ? ?
"Not really , it seems to me ."
Despite these facts the question `` : :
Should no murderer ever be executed '' ? ?
"1 ,"
"2 ,"
"`` Oh , for the green of Europe ! !"
`` Something much more thorough is required '' .
As Lester Pearson wrote in 1955 : :
`` NATO cannot live on fear alone .
There is nothing new in this ; ;
"6 ,"
Constitutions of and by themselves mean little ; ;
That is the lesson of the nineteenth century .
Even musicians themselves have taken to writing poetry .
)
Actually Heaven and the Dark Kingdom overlap ; ;
they form two aspects of heavenly life after death .
Patchen has almost never used strict poetic forms ; ;
he has experimented instead with personal myth-making .
His approach to music is highly individualistic ; ;
the accent is on improvisation rather than arrangements .
The musician is non-intellectual and non-verbal ; ;
`` Anger won't help .
I was born angry .
Can't hold her little white han' ! !
Can't hold her pure little han' ! !
Neither of these poems is an aberration ; ;
Patchen is repeatedly preoccupied with death .
Let us see just how typical Krim is .
He is New York-born and Jewish .
I do not want to quibble about typicality ; ;
they sweated out some kind of formal education ; ;
they read widely and eclectically ; ;
And they traveled out of New York .
we were also literary ; ;
Some of us have imagination and sensibility too .
fear .
"over , the , country -- ."
This Partisan above all did ; ;
But it did print good verse and good fiction .
"the result was his inevitable bedazzlement through , ignorance ."
this moment are being bedazzled by half-digested ideas .
Ideas are the thruway to nowhere .
The Italians felt it .
Little things .
So were a lot of other people .
He was interested in Italo Svevo .
This one was going to be different .
"Berto seemed worried , too ."
Berto knew all about Fascism .
"So did his friend , the young novelist Rimanelli ."
So there we were talking around and about it .
I thought : Who is older now ? ?
Old world and new world .
He had made an assault once with 180 men .
It was a picked assault company .
Object -- a village crossroads .
"`` Bullshit '' , he said softly ."
"`` Excuse me '' , the European said ."
`` I am not familiar with the expression '' .
There is a bronze wreath on the wall .
I have seen diapers strung across the ruined roof .
She had her reasons for this .
Therefore the government wanted no part of him .
And then there were other things .
I suffer from mixed feelings .
He was never heard of again .
He really didn't know how to fly .
He had crashed on takeoff once before .
It was absurd and dramatic .
"No poetry , no airplanes , no dancers ."
She was from Prague .
She showed us what had happened to her .
"No airplanes , no Nathan Hale statements ."
There was a pretty thorough silence at that point .
I thought : What the hell ? ?
Why not ? ?
I said I would do it for her .
"I had some reasons , too ."
I admire the English lady .
I also had and have feelings about Garibaldi .
So much for all that .
The English lady was pleased and enthusiastic .
The idea of the march pleased her .
"Maybe twenty , thirty , fifty ."

Concluding remarks
6.4 .
The primary decomposition theorem
What can we do with the general T ? ?
This is clearly a deficiency in T .
Thus T is not diagonalizable .
Theorem 12 .
( primary decomposition theorem ) .
Let Af be the null space of Af .
Then ( A ) Af ; ;
Proof .
The idea of the proof is this .
"For each i , let Af ."
Thus there are polynomials Af such that Af .
Let Af .
This completes the proof of statement ( A ) .
Then Af .
It is easily seen that Af divides G .
Hence the minimal polynomial for Af is Af .
Corollary .
Let us put Af .
Let us look at the operator Af .
Now Af Af so Af .
Definition .
Theorem 13 .
Proof .
We shall prove that Af .
hence they commute with D and with N .
Such an operator is obviously the zero operator ; ;
Thus we see that Af and Af .
Corollary .
Example 11 .
Then Af .
"that is , Af , etc. ."
Thus Af if and only if Af .

Examples of binomial experiments
We begin with a few examples of binomial experiments .
Marksmanship example .
Inheritance in mice .
Aces ( ones ) with three dice .
General binomial problem .
Example 1 .
Student football managers .
On three Fridays the coach has needed a driver .
Exactly 2 times ? ?
1 time ? ?
0 times ? ?
Discussion .
Note that there are 3 trials of interest .
We now generalize these ideas for general binomial experiments .
1 .
Experiment without a fixed number of trials .
Toss a die until an ace appears .
2 .
Binomial trials .
Experiment without the two-class property .
3 .
All trials have identical probabilities of success .
Experiment where p is not constant .
4 .
The trials are independent .
Examples where independence fails .
The following is a less extreme example of dependence .
Consider couples visiting an art museum .
Table 7-1 illustrates the point .
To summarize :
The outcome of the experiment is X successes .
then the number of successes is always 0 ) .
Random variables .
Example 2 .
These are real analytic periodic functions with period T .
The points may also touch C without crossing .
Suppose Af crosses C when Af .
The function f{t} defined in this way is multi-valued .
We can now prove several lemmas .
Lemma 1 .
Proof .
"Therefore , Af is single-valued near Q ."
Lemma 2 .
Proof .
Definition .
Lemma 3 .
Proof
.
We suppose not .
Suppose Af is defined in the sub-interval Af .
"We have Af , plus tangent points ."
These s-values are just the ordinary values of Af .
Lemma 4 .
Proof .
Introduction .
1 .
The line Af is the image of L .
"Clearly , the transformation is involutorial ."
Hence C' is a Af curve on Q .

Death is not permanent defeat and disappearance ; ;
man has a second chance .
he has endless being .

The two have never been separable .
Religion integrates and unifies .
Religion fosters group life in various ways .
Religion usually exercises a stabilizing-conserving function .

Syllabification .
Sometimes even the number of syllables is not clear .
No single explanation is adequate to account for this .
The second need is better field techniques .
"As these maladies overlap , so must the cure ."
The third need is for better theory .
Actual practice does not often work out this way .
Welmers has suggested one explanation .
Tone and intonation often become seriously intermeshed .

It is not that such questions are not asked .
This is the course the positivists took .
They explained value judgments by explaining them away .
Now I do not think their view will do .
The attempt failed : the animal is now dead .
Consider what follows from the positivist view .
Clearly not .
Clearly it is not .
The pain in itself was neutral ; ;
The pathetic evidence is no longer before us ; ;
And this seems to me untrue .
I come now to a fourth consideration .
But that is not exactly my point .
Let me illustrate .

But here we have a distinctly modern preoccupation ; ;
What is new about it ? ?
To that question the answer is simple ; ;
Surely there is nothing new about communism .
Utopian communism applies to all Utopians .
`` The soil is common to all men .
The Utopians brace conscience with legal sanctions .
It is not merely a new thing ; ;

It is the difference between Bach and Mozart .
Thomas's ellipses and ambiguities are ends in themselves .
Emotionally it does not resemble Berlioz or Wagner ; ;

It is much more a personal difference .
Ornament is confabulation in the interstices of structure .
Confabulation has come to determine structure .

Necessity for an over-all concept
Thinking on submarine defense has not always been clear-cut .
An over-all concept would have other advantages .
Now the problem is presented piecemeal and sometimes contradictorily .
"Lacking guidance , industry picks its own areas ."
Principles involved in an over-all concept
The next developments will probably be in weaponry .
The world is constantly changing ; ;
what was new yesterday is obsolescent today .

Large area coverage will accomplish all other tasks .
In submarine defense these must have maximum stress .
Environmental intelligence is just as important .
The ocean presently co-operates with the target .
All capabilities must be used to maximum advantage then .
There may be others .
Mines are being increasingly oriented against submarine targets .
Effective employment will reduce force requirements .
Such systems are expensive and are oriented geographically .

Scotty did not go back to school .
"Rachel was polite , Scotty indifferent ."
His father tried to make the food a topic .
"`` The blueberry pie is good , Scotty ."
I recommend it '' .
"He looked at his son , his face worried ."
His face was fuller ; ;
"He looked lazy , spoiled , a little querulous ."
Rachel had little to say .
"It was a strained , silent lunch ."
They did not speak much .
"He said , `` Nothing '' ."
He felt tired and full and calm .
Thirty-four
"`` You don't eat enough , honey ."
Try to get that down '' .
It'll take time '' .
Scotty was neutral .
His energy was gone .
his mouth hung slightly open .
He had not mentioned Kate .
it was merely another part of his weakness .
"He was calm , drugged , and lazy ."
He did not care .
Rachel mentioned Kate .
"Scotty said , `` That's all right ."
Kate's all right '' .
She was with Elizabeth .
They were far off and looked tiny .
`` I imagine you're always battling in school '' .
`` I don't go to school any more '' .
`` Pardon '' ? ?
The doctor had to bend close to hear ; ;
Scotty said the same words more loudly .
`` Oh .
He turned unsmilingly to Rachel .
it would exhaust him further and unnecessarily .
He'll be stronger soon '' .
The stethoscope glinted silver in the darkening room .
Rachel stayed on after the doctor had gone .
She did not touch him .
Scotty watched with disinterest .
He did not speak .
He had no desire to .
He did not care .
He shook his head .
`` We've had any number of calls about you .
Miss Estherson called twice .
She wants to pay you a visit .
She says the children miss you .
Apparently you were the light of their lives '' .
Scotty shrugged slightly .
She was frowning .
`` That doctor annoys me '' .
She seemed to speak to herself .
She turned to him again .
She was very worried '' .
Rachel's tone was dry .
"Scotty said , `` I don't know '' ."
It was true .
He did not .
"`` Well , there's time , in any case ."
"Scotty said , `` Okay '' ."
This time Rachel kissed him lightly on the forehead .
Scotty was pleased .
His father was a constant visitor .
it floated up the stairs .
`` How's Scotty '' ? ?
And Rachel's or Virginia's reply : `` better .
He's getting plenty of rest '' .
`` Is his appetite improved '' ? ?
Or : `` Does he get exercise '' ? ?
He never smiled .
"`` I'm eating more '' , he would say ."
`` Perhaps you should get out a little '' .
`` I'm not supposed to yet '' .
He was not irritated .
"He did not mind the useless , kindly questions ."
`` Have you got enough blankets '' ? ?
"There the objective sat , brooding over all ."
The raped valley was a pregnant womb awaiting abortion .
Was it all vain labor ? ?
Was this what he had expected ? ?
There was just too much time .
Time to become afraid .
He hadn't even seen him yet
He had come here in order to test himself .
"Yet , he was here ."
Prevot had briefed the two new men that afternoon .
`` Be sure the man nearest you is awake .
"Otherwise , we hold a reception ."
That still holds .
We bring back all dead and wounded '' .
Then began the journey through their own mine fields .
Mines .
"Ours were kinder than theirs , some said ."
Mines .
Big ones and little .
But theirs defied the detectors .
Mines .
"A foot misplaced , a leg missing ."

It was dark .
"Thus , stealthily they advanced upstream ; ;"
Somewhere over there another patrol had need of light .
White's arm went up and Warren raised his own .
The patrol was stopping .
Prevot came up `` .
`` Give me your machine gun ammo '' .
This he placed within quick reach .
Figures seemed to crouch in the surrounding dark ; ;
Pierre had no hands ; ;
they had been severed at the wrists .
He and Warren had traveled together for four days .
`` Wait ! !
Wait '' ! !
"`` C'est formidable '' , they exclaimed ."
"`` Mais , oui ."
C'est merveilleux '' .
`` They are also honest seekers after truth .
It will be good for you .
`` Will you please wait in here .
His friend Jane was with him .
This meant sorting out press clippings and the like .
Jane sat receptive and interested .
It's like focusing a camera ; ;
You know what I'm talking about .
"That's to say , he was trigger happy ."
But not in front of Trig .
The fear of punishment just didn't bother him .
It wasn't there .
It was left out of him at birth .
This is why he made such a magnificent soldier .
Jane nodded with a pleasant smile .
`` All right .
Trig was one of the five volunteers .
You could hear them from our outpost .
There was a lot of shooting .
So we hurried over .
"Jane asked in her placid , interested way ."
Mickie laughed .
But not Jeff Lawrence .
These were heroes nine feet tall to him '' .
Beside him was Mrs. Dalloway .
Poverty imposes a kind of chastity on the ambitious .
"And so he had , so he had ."
He was not stone .
He was not unmoved .
"At law school , the same ."
Perhaps it was right ; ;
perhaps it was just .
But then his son could afford it .
Lawrence was waiting for Bill Boxell .
He said the matter was urgent .
The Secretary was uneasy about the visit .
He did not like Boxell .
He suspected something underhanded and furtive about him .
It did not .
A half hour later the Vice President arrived .
How did you find out about this '' ? ?
He waved his arm around at the furnishings .
"It was not a discourteous question , Lawrence decided ."
he had to find out .
I can do business with that kind '' .
They had brandy in the library .
What are your weaknesses ? ?
Where will you break ? ?
How best to destroy your peace ? ?
Old Chris is my ideal .
What does a monk know about sex '' ? ?
You see what I mean .
Let me tell you what happened to me today .
"Literally , there was nothing else to do ."
He was caught in a machine .
Beyond were industries and factories .
Then they went down to Black Bottom .
But it was a landmark .
He had no chance to say another word .
During the next weeks he looked over the situation .
The church itself must be repaired .
It was dirty and neglected .
"Meanwhile , the city itself should be talked to ."
The streets in the colored section were dirty .
There was typhoid and malaria .
"The school was small , dark and ill-equipped ."
The teacher was a pliant fool .
the other exclusively Negro .
Wilson inquired about it .
It was called Kent House .
there were two or three colored maids employed there .
But nevertheless it looked respectable .
He was glad to have it there .
"some were trash dumps , some had flower gardens ."
He talked about it to the Presiding Elder .
The Presiding Elder looked him over rather carefully .
And Wilson tried .
It did seem impossible .
The church certainly would not be removed .
The very proposition was sacrilege .
It had been here fifty years .
It was going to stay forever .
Hope to see you again '' .
And he dismissed the colored pastor .
I was just asking about it .
What is it '' ? ?
Wilson stared at her .
"`` My dear , you must be mistaken '' ."
"`` Talk to Mrs. Catt '' , she said ."
But this situation of Kent House was more subtle .
The wages involved were larger and more regular .
He might have been anywhere or nowhere .
Secretary of State Seward was a sick man .
The sick were always receiving medicines .
No one would question such an errand .
The bottle was filled up with flour .
Now it would have another death .
"It was still Good Friday , after all ."
A nigger boy opened the door .
Payne did not notice him .
He was thinking chiefly of Cap .
He pushed his way inside .
For a moment the hall confused him .
He had no idea where Seward's room would be .
Above him somewhere were the bedrooms .
Seward would be up there .
He was no longer worried .
Everything would be all right .
"Still , the sensation always surprised him ."
It was a thrill he felt no part in .
He stopped and whispered his errand .
Young Frederick Seward held out his hand .
"Panting a little , Payne shook his head ."
"`` Very well '' , Payne said ."
`` I will go '' .
He pulled out his pistol and fired it .
It made no sound .
It had misfired .
It was the first blow that was always difficult .
"After that , violence was exultantly easy ."
It was not murder at all .
Payne was more methodical than that .
A knife would do .
From childhood he had known all about knives .
Someone blocked the door from inside .
He smashed it in and tumbled into darkness .
Two men pulled him off .
Nobody said anything .
Payne hacked at their arms .
"There was a lady there , in a nightdress ."
He would not have wanted to hurt a lady .
"Another man approached , this one fully dressed ."
That would have made things so much easier .
But he was not mad .
He was only dreaming .
The clammy air revived him .
"Herold , he saw , had fled ."
The nigger boy was close behind him .
He rode on and on .
He had no idea where he was .
After some time he came to an open field .
Cap would find him and take care of him .
Acting soothed him .
"The audience , as usual , loved it ."
He was delighted to see them so happy .
"7 ,"
Wilkes was quite right about one thing .
Laura Keene had been in the green room .
The commotion had brought her into the wings .
Meanwhile it looked at the scenery .
"Said Trenchard , otherwise Hawk ."
That was when the gun went off .
Yet even that explosion did not mean much .
"`` Sic semper tyrannis '' , it said mildly ."
Booth had delivered his line .
Behind him billowed a small pungent cloud of smoke .
They strained forward .
They had not heard what had been said .
His speech faltered .
He did not lower his arm .
This figure looked like the slave dealer from that .
Then it disappeared into the wings .
Mrs. Lincoln screamed .
There was no mistaking that scream .
Yet this scream had a different note in it .
Her action was involuntary .
Mrs. Lincoln screamed again .
That got everybody up .
"On the stage , Harry Hawk began to weep ."
The crowd began to move .
It would not give .
He went straight to the Presidential box .
Rathbone said he was bleeding to death .
But the stranger was nimbler still .
The stranger leered .
It was absurd .
Stevie could feel himself toppling .
The blow encountered silky hair and hard bone .
"He gloated , and his lips slavered ."
He heard himself chortling .
Stevie was shouting triumphantly .
A train hooted .
"Instantly , he chilled ."
They were pursuing him .
He was frightened ; ;
his fists clutched so tightly that his knuckles hurt .
`` Stevie ! !
Stevie '' ! !
"`` Stevie , wake up now ! !"
We're nearly there '' .
He had been dreaming .
He was safe in his Mama's arms .
The train had slowed .
`` Po' Chavis '' ! !
The trainman called .
Chapter 6
Bong ! !
Bong ! !
Startled him awake .
Bong ! !
A dull boom and a throbbing echo .
Bong ! !
Bong ! !
"The wood was old , the paint alligatored ."
Bong ! !
A fresh breeze saluted him .
Six o'clock ! !
He put his head out .
There was the slate roof of the church ; ;
The clock which had struck presented an innocent face .
In the kitchen Mama was wiping the cupboards .
"`` I know , Stephen '' , she smiled ."
"He dressed , and sped outdoors ."
He crossed Broome Street to Orange Square .
The spire seemed to hold up the sky .
Stevie whistled when he passed these alien grounds .
To know God he must follow in Papa's footsteps .
"He was fortunate , and proud ."
-- and crossed the suspension bridge to Matamoras ; ;
that was Pennsylvania .
"However , a boy's lively eyes might rove ."
Stevie saw no idols ; ;
`` Where you been today '' ? ?
"`` No , he won't '' ! !"
Stevie flared .
`` Not me '' ! !
I heard them ! !
Uncle and Aunt Howe were the witnesses '' .
`` Will he die '' ? ?
`` Everybody does '' .
Ludie could be hateful .
To speak of Papa dying was a sin .
Stevie was constantly slipping into the church .
The figure was wreathed in an extraordinary luminescence .
Would Papa really die ? ?
For he feared the Lake of Fire .
he must pray to be spared .
Someday God would choose him .
It would summon him once ; ;
"if he missed it , never again ."
He must not fail to hear it .
He was Papa's chosen ; ;
he dared to wait for the lightning .
But he was good .
He clenched his fists and faced the terror .
Thunder crashed ; ;
not of Drew Church .
Violet whinnied from the stable .
"`` Don't be afraid , Violet '' ! !"
"He shouted , and was aghast at the echoes ."
`` Don't you be afraid '' ! !
He would save her .
"`` Don't you be afraid , Violet '' ! !"
He jumped .
The pointed shadow had nearly touched him .
`` Go on home '' ! !
Ludie screeched at him .
`` Someone'll tell Papa '' ! !
Ludie did as he pleased .
Ludie chewed roofer's tar .
Stevie envied him .
That Ludie ! !
Stevie yearned for a dog .
She was taller than Aggie .
Fiddles screeched ; ;
a piano tinkled .
If the crummy bastard could write ! !
That's how it should be .
It's those two fucken niggers ! !
"Krist , I wish they could write ! !"
Nigger pussy .
He thought of sweet wet nigger pussy .
"He thought of her , the first one ."
He had caught her coming out of the shack .
She was a juicy one .
Oh how they bounced ! !
"Man , how I love nigger pussy ! !"
"He chuckled , the memory vivid ."
"Jee-sus , We Fixed him ! !"
"Yooee , we fixed him ! !"
The snow again .
If only the fucken weather wasn't so lousy ! !
"Goddamn niggers , Lord ."
What I have to put up with ! !
"Only one worth a shit , and that's Brandon ."
He ain't so bad .
His thoughts turned to other things .
Kaboom for .
Soon came back to his senses .
Look at thum .
That goddamn redheader was the worst .
"But I told him , goddammit ."
That'll put the place back to normal .
"Normal , by God ."
Maybe it's a good thing it happened .
"Maybe they'll stop it now , once for all ."
Clean the place up .
They're doin it now .
They'll get the guys that done it .
Keerist .
Prickly twinges of annoyance ran through him .
A tune began to whirl inside his head .
One of his favorites : `` Guitar Boogie '' .
Months .
"Hired , hard lackeys of the Warmongering capitalists ."
"Not captured , sent here ."
To fuck up the program .
You guys remember that .
Remember that He heard himself haranguing them .
He saw himself before them delivering the speech .
He would ! !
"That was really something , coming from Ching ."
"`` Really something '' , he said , aloud ."
He felt intense satisfaction .
He was tingling within .
It was as if it had been done .
"He halted , and looked around ."
Rivers of cold sweat were suddenly unleashed within him .
He tried to stifle it .
But the words were forming .
He knew he couldn't .
He braced himself .
Somebody'll hafta start thinkin .
But it didn't .
And he took heart ; ;
the final word came forth .
"Now he heard it , fully ; ;"
He felt good .
His old self .
"The music arrived , taking him its rhythm ."
He is good .
Damn good .
But a nigger .
Johnson .
"Jesus , the guy says he is trying ."
No one is stupid .
That's what he said .
He oughta know .
It is plain as hell Johnson is no reactionary .
How he loathed him .
Why me ? ?
Why didn't the damn Reactionaries bump him off ? ?
Why Slater ? ?
Who is the man to take His place ? ?
The guy with most on the Ball .
Most on the ball .
Handle men .
Thoroughly Wised up .
He turned to the window again .
A gnawing and gnashing within him .
The snow was tumbling down furiously now .
"He stared at it , amazed , alarmed ."
The whole fucken sky's cavin in ! !
Keeeerist ! !
Lookit it ! !
Jesus ! !
Maybe they already got them .
"Ching , Tien , all of them ."
Top dog .
Poor ol Slater .
He whirled about suddenly .
Somebody was up .
That was all .
The man moved away .
That's the way .
They'll toe the line .
Goddamn it .
Less bull the more you can do with em .
That's Brown's trouble .
Plenty of room there now .
All those dumb 8-Balls croaked .
Anything .
They'd cut their mothers' belly open .
Give um the works .
"Coughlin grinned , feeling supremely on top of things ."
He watched the snow once again .
It infuriated him .
It made no sense to him .
"`` You , Listen ! !"
-- name William Foster's Four Internal Contradictions in Capitalism .
Quick -- Quick -- now '' ! !
Finnegan woke up .
He stared out the window .
For Christ's sake ! !
The whole fucken sky's caved in ! !
It was that prick Coughlin .
What the hell was he up to now ? ?
Why didn't he drop dead ? ?
How ? ?
Is this a nut-house ? ?
Am I nuts ? ?
Is this for real ? ?
Am I dreamin ? ?
From somewhere in the hut came Coughlin's voice .
`` How long did you study ? ?
"How long , buddy '' ? ?"
`` For Christ's sake '' ! !
A voice pleaded .
"`` Don't Christsake me , buddy ! !"
Just answer .
C'mon -- 'mon ! !
''
I'm no hero .
Did I start the damn war ? ?
"Automatically , Finnegan started going over today's lesson ."
Capitalism rots from the core .
Did I start the damn war ? ?
Who did ? ?
That's a good one .
I thought I knew .
I'll bet both together did .
I bet .
So fuck them both .
Goddamn .
Goddammit .
Fuck them .
He snuggled into the blanket .
Brandon dreamed .
The log was spinning .
But he was not .
So what ? ?
He couldn't make out what he was saying .
No doubt it had to do with the log .
Why should he be concerned ? ?
`` A learned man '' ? ?
The bandit laughs in his face .
But Voltaire perseveres .
He goes to the chief himself .
`` At what university did you study '' ? ?
He asks .
"Could he have pen and paper , please ? ?"
How cruel ! !
But at the same time how understandable .
This time as a musician .
As a composer .
But his facility in this genre was not great .
And for good reasons .
His operatic music had little merit .
He didn't believe them .
"`` Nonsense '' , he said ."
`` Heaven forbid '' ! !
"Cried the ladies , enchanted by his music ."
Or at least appear to reject it ! !
But what else could he do ? ?
But now music too ? ?
No .
That would be too much ! !
"And the fault , of course , was Rameau's ."
But no .
He couldn't appear as a composer now .
The ladies were delighted and Jean Jacques was applauded .
The ladies especially couldn't understand what troubled him .
A contradiction ? ?
Merely to satisfy the author's curiosity .
Rousseau agreed .
That would certainly be paradoxical .
But Duclos thought he saw a way out .
`` Your name will never appear .
To that Rousseau could agree .
Imagine the honor of it ! !
`` What was your answer '' ? ?
"Jean Jacques asked , striving to appear unimpressed ."
"`` I refused '' , Duclos said ."
`` What else could I do ? ?
"Monsieur De Cury was incensed , of course ."
And I was certain he would refuse '' .
How infuriating all this was ! !
-- he had to play a role of self-effacement .
`` You can't go in that way '' ! !
They cried .
`` Why not '' ? ?
Jean Jacques asked .
`` Who is going to stop me '' ? ?
`` You haven't dressed for the occasion '' ! !
They pointed out to him .
`` Neither better nor worse '' .
"`` At home , yes '' , they argued ."
`` But here you are in the palace .
There's the King .
And Madame De Pompadour '' .
`` And even more right .
Since I am the composer '' ! !
`` But in such a slovenly condition '' .
`` What is slovenly about me '' ? ?
Rousseau asked .
That's the fashion .
And fashion is the real king here .
"Not Louis 15 , , since even he obeys ."
He trembled lest his piece should fail .
"Here , before the court ? ?"
Before the King ? ?
`` They're a-coming ! !
"That's understandable , and I appreciate the sentiment ."
"`` Committeemen , hold your fire ! !"
Hold your fire '' ! !
but I have no memory of that .
Everyone else was running .
Mattathias Dover said :
`` It makes sense .
"`` I learned that now '' , I said ."
Three men were around him .
Cousin Simmons roared .
Dancing was no longer permitted in the streets .
The Bordel and other places of prostitution were emptied .
The slit breeches had to go .
Drunkenness was no longer tolerated .
John's first impulse was to denounce their blasphemy .
John stiffened in anger .
John's reply was like a declaration of war .
`` What Master Calvin says is true .
`` Do not listen to that Frenchman .
John was quietly insistent .
Not even Varnessa ; ;
"she , too , prayed only to God ."
But he had to follow the light .
John recognized Ablard Corne and called out a greeting .
How grateful he was to such men ! !
John leaned upon the stone balustrade .
above him the deep blue sky glittered with stars .
"`` How long , my Lord ? ?"
How long ? ?
Sleep was difficult these days .
Indigestion plagued him .
Severe headaches were frequent .
We will have righteousness '' ! !
Eli Corault ! !
John thought .
What is he doing here at this hour ? ?
`` John ? ?
Is that you ? ?
"John stood above him , his face ashen ."
What now ? ?
`` Plot '' ? ?
John asked tiredly .
`` Monsieur Favre just paid me a visit .
It is to be a trap .
`` What will be the subject '' ? ?
Anger and fear fused in John .
He asked to be appointed a preacher .
John sighed .
`` There is more to the conspiracy .
`` It was always the spirit with Christ ; ;
matters such as leavened or unleavened bread are inconsequential .
Geneva must remain a sovereign state .
`` What was your reply to that '' ? ?
"He stood very still , his heart thumping wildly ."
The chinless Jake called .
`` Arianist '' ! !
`` Heretic '' ! !
John lifted his hand for silence .
His voice shook a little .
Somebody heaved a stone .
For an instant John was stunned .
"Before he could duck , another stone struck him ."
And another .
`` Let him be now '' ! !
`` We have taught him a lesson '' .
Fists pummeled him as he staggered forward .
He recognized the gesture .
He knew its meaning .
Now the face was his own .
What was he expiating ? ?
This was Virginia .
The men were huddled in those lairs .
Adam knew the names of some .
His heart suddenly opened to joy .
Lemme tell you now '' --
Adam watched the moisture flow from the poncho .
The street was again empty .
"The feet wore army shoes , in obvious disrepair ."
The gray face stared straight ahead in the drizzle .
Then the figure moved on .
They did washing .
Adam recognized this one .
"`` Slice o' mutton , bhoy '' ? ?"
She had queried in her soft guttural .
`` Slice o' mutton '' ? ?
Her name was Mollie .
"They called her Mollie the Mutton , and laughed ."
Mollie the Mutton was scratching her nose .
The pattern would not stop .
It came again and again .
Suddenly he thought he might weep .
`` What's the matter with me '' ? ?
He demanded out loud .
He demanded .
Then he --
Then what ? ?
He did not know .
He stopped .
He strained to hear .
''
He thought : I am a Jew from Bavaria .
He had plunged into the dark woods beyond .
He had died there .
In the pity for them his loneliness was gone .
A pot was boiling on the coals .
Mose asked softly .
Adam nodded .
"`` Yeah '' , Mose murmured , `` yeah ."
And look what he done give us '' .
Adam looked at the pot .
`` What is it '' ? ?
He asked .
"`` Gre't big fat chicken , yeah '' ."
He licked his lips again .
Then : `` yeah .
And it squealed for slop '' .
Mose giggled .
"`` Fooled you , huh ? ?"
It is sowbelly with tits on .
It is salt po'k .
It is salt po'k and skippers .
He stopped stirring and looked over his shoulder .
`` Know what Ole Buckra et tonight '' ? ?
He demanded .
Adam shook his head .
"`` Chicken '' , Mose said ."
Fritzie was on the couch reading ; ;
She envied him .
She admired him .
"In the darkness , she saw him stirring ."
`` 'nother minute I'd have been fine .
H'all should have let me do it '' .
Laura touched his hand .
"`` Yes , I know , Fritzie ."
I should have '' .
Tuesday
The heat intensified on Tuesday .
Selena was the wrong woman for these crudities .
Sergeant Moll understood .
Her speech was barren of southernisms ; ;
`` Maybe today'll be a good-news day '' .
She charged off to the bedrooms .
Moll took his coffee into the nursery .
Someone would have to remain in the office continually .
"McFeeley greeted the parents , then studied his notebook ."
`` Sleep well '' ? ?
He asked .
Andrus did not answer him .
"`` Oh -- we managed '' , she said ."
`` I'm a little groggy .
Did anything happen during the night '' ? ?
"`` Few crank calls '' , McFeeley said ."
We can expect more of the same .
Too bad your number is in the directory '' .
The three had little to say to each other .
Kidnaper spurns ransom ; ;
Amy still missing .
"Outside , only a handful of reporters remained ."
The street cleaner had not yet been around .
McFeeley identified himself .
"No , they hadn't seen anyone around ; ;"
"no , they didn't know the Andrus family ; ;"
"yes , they had read about the case ; ;"
He had spoken to Mrs. .
Emerson the previous day .
each shrub glazed with good health .
Mrs. Kahler joined them .
Both were dressed rather formally .
McFeeley looked puzzled .
`` I hit him in the ass once '' .
Both grinned at the detective .
She was intimidated by the stove .
The gas flamed up two inches high .
They found the teakettle .
Several sections of a loaf of dark bread ; ;
butter ; ;
jam ; ;
a tiny cake of ice .
`` Do you want to call Eugene '' ? ?
A sleepy voice answered .
The chair creaked .
Eugene told him and he promptly forgot .
Nothing was said about hotels or train journeys .
They all three had another cup of coffee .
Harold shook his head .
Alix and Eugene on their wedding day .
"Mme Vienot , considerably younger and very different ."
The schoolboy .
"Professor Cestre , could it be ? ?"
Beethoven's Fifth was the one on top .
Da-da-da-dum Music could not be Eugene's passion .
"Besides , the records were dusty ."
He tried the doors of the bookcase .
Locked .
No poetry .
No novels .
"`` Call the Vouillemont , I guess '' ."
`` I guess '' .
"They looked , even so ."
Looked at everything .
"`` Oh no '' , Harold said , shocked ."
He's probably spending the evening with friends '' .
He felt them .
They were damp .
Damp also .
`` What is it '' ? ?
"Barbara asked , standing in the doorway ."
`` I've solved the mystery of the little bag .
But where do people go swimming in Paris ? ?
"That boat in the river , maybe '' ."
`` What boat '' ? ?
She looked at him in surprise .
`` All because I didn't feel like dancing '' .
`` Then what was it '' ? ?
`` I don't know .
I wish I did .
"The tweed coat , maybe ."
They would feel what Mary was undergoing .
"There would be no halos , no angels ."
"Now she was intensely alive , anguished ; ;"
her son was dead .
only what Mary felt for her son .
Mary would have to carry the human communication .
This seemed right to him .
Michelangelo grinned .
`` Not at all .
Each religion has its own tenets '' .
I wish to make Jesus an authentic Jew .
I'm sure he would approve '' .
`` Workmen .
In their mid-thirties .
"Not bulky laborers , but sinewy men ."
With intelligence .
And sensitivity '' .
`` Leave me your address .
Sangallo studied the drawings and improvised a trestle couch .
Michelangelo bought some scrap lumber .
His first model arrived at dusk .
The model quite plainly thought Michelangelo crazy ; ;
Mary presented quite a different problem .
Jacopo Galli introduced him into several Roman homes .
they remained rough starting points .
When carving he was charged with spontaneous energy ; ;
Drawing and models were his thinking .
Carving was action .
10 .
`` You're too clean .
Scrub the studio once a week .
That's enough '' .
"`` No '' , said Argiento stolidly ."
`` Every day .
Before dawn .
I was taught '' .
Grumbled Michelangelo ; ;
`` Today I go see the horses '' .
He assumed he could blink the splinter out .
But it would not come .
By the second day Michelangelo began to worry ; ;
At dawn Argiento went to Jacopo Galli .
"Galli arrived with his family surgeon , Maestro Lippi ."
The surgeon carried a cage of live pigeons .
The scant flesh grew cool beneath her frantic hands .
The child was gone .
''
`` Trouble never comes but in threes '' .
"God would not do that , Kate thought stubbornly ."
She loved him and missed his company .
What it was Kate could not fathom .
"Joel knew what he was about , however ."
He tended the new colts Beau had sired .
Winking at Joel's look of shock .
Kate and Mrs. Tussle waited for letters anxiously .
I wish our doctor could have saved her '' .
"She asked him , seeing Juanita's eyes grow bleak ."
`` When are you to leave '' ? ?
"Kate asked , watching them both now anxiously ."
`` Tomorrow .
"She sought Kate out upstairs , her lips trembling ."
`` What do you want to do '' ? ?
`` I could go with him .
But I am a slave ! !
You own me .
"`` No , the decision is yours ."
`` I don't hear the music .
`` Where is everyone ? ?
"I say , where is everyone ? ?"
Was it a birthday ball ? ?
When Peter had reached his majority at eighteen ? ?
He pulled out one of them and cocked it .
-- flapped as it ran .
Its groin was bloody .
Black strips of skin hung from it .
David took a firm hand with it .
Then it was gone .
"He drove on , wary and shaken ."
The Sons were out tonight .
Chapter 10
It commanded a view over Manhattan and the harbor .
They often threw tidbits overboard .
their rock paths led down to the Hudson .
"Pensive , introspective , he ached ."
Now there was more to do .
He scratched his mosquito-plagued neck .
He hoped he was free of self-deception .
But it did not matter .
He stropped the razor slowly ; ;
"Unique circumstances would test us all , he decided ."
Injury and ingratitude would occur .
No doubt John Hancock would do well now ; ;
war was a smugglers' heaven .
Life was a short play of tenebrous shadows .
David began to shave with great sweeping strokes .
"He felt cheerful again , refreshed ; ;"
It is so easy to falsify sentiment .
The future would happen ; ;
He began to pack the saddlebags .
Peasants puzzled Andrei .
Andrei remembered a Bathyran meeting long ago .
Had he found the meaning too late ? ?
It aggravated him .
This is our singular goal .
Where we end our journey is always the same .
This was how Alexander Brandel expressed pure Zionism .
"Warsaw is my city , not Tel Aviv '' ."
Warsaw ! !
Warsaw ! !
Warsaw ! !
`` Miss Rak .
I am a Jew '' .
He ground his teeth together .
"I hate Warsaw , he said to himself ."
All of Poland is a coffin .
What matters now ? ?
What is beyond this fog ? ?
Deportees .
Jews .
Andrei's skilled eye sized them up .
They were not Poles .
He guessed by their appearance that they were Rumanians .
The Bathyrans were all gone .
He and Ana watched it carefully .
Globocnik built the Death's-Head Corps .
Lublin was their heart .
What was happening in Majdanek ? ?
His watch told him he was still early .
`` Captain Androfski '' ! !
Styka sat beside him and pumped his hand excitedly .
Styka studied his captain .
He almost broke into tears .
Styka nodded and sniffed and blew his nose vociferously .
Styka grumbled about fate .
Not a bad girl .
So we have three children and responsibilities .
I work at the granary .
Who complains ? ?
`` I understand '' .
Styka blew his nose again .
Andrei asked .
I did exactly as instructed .
`` His answer '' ? ?
`` Ten thousand zlotys '' .
`` Can he be trusted '' ? ?
"`` Good man , Styka '' ."
`` Captain Jan must you go inside Majdanek ? ?
"`` Not everyone , Styka '' ."
`` What good will it really do '' ? ?
`` I don't know .
`` I have to believe it '' .
Styka shook his head slowly .
`` I am only a simple soldier .
I cannot think things out too well .
I hated you when I first came in .
"Hell , sir ."
Andrei smiled .
Why '' ? ?
`` But we are neither blind nor insane .
"I've lost faith , Styka ."
The question frightened Andrei .
`` Please don't go inside Majdanek '' .
It was an answer that Styka understood .
Half of it dripped down his chin .
`` Well '' ? ?
Andrei demanded .
Grabski looked at the pair of them .
He grunted a sort of `` yes '' answer .
`` My cousin works at the Labor Bureau .
He can make you work papers .
It will take a few days .
`` Orders from the Home Army '' .
`` Why ? ?
Nothing there but Jews '' .
Andrei shrugged .
`` We get strange orders '' .
`` Well -- what about the money '' ? ?
Andrei peeled off five one-thousand-zloty notes .
Grabski had never seen so much money .
`` This ain't enough '' .
Andrei and Styka were silent .
She was getting real dramatic .
I didn't want her back on that broken record .
"`` I am '' , she said ."
I was crazy about her all over again .
It was the call of the wild all right .
We moved down Broadway from ginmill to ginmill .
It was the same old routine .
I hate it .
I hate it '' .
It was a walk up on Hudson Street .
`` What about Ballestre '' ? ?
I had to shake her to make her listen .
`` Precious .
What about him '' ? ?
Suddenly she was very mysterious and dramatic .
`` Precious and I allow each other absolute freedom .
We are above being jealous .
He's used to me bringing home strange men .
I'll just tell him you're my husband .
He can't object to that '' .
`` Well I object .
`` That really would be funny '' .
She began to laugh .
After all I'm made of flesh and blood .
I'm not a plaster saint .
Waking up was horrible .
We both had hangovers .
There was somebody else in the apartment .
I stiffened .
I turned around with the percolator in my hand .
"Brown eyes , eyebrow mustache ."
Oval face without an expression in the world .
`` Joseph Maria Ballestre meet Francis Xavier Bowman .
Exboyfriend meet exhusband '' .
She gave the nastiest laugh I ever heard .
She was enjoying the situation .
Imagine that .
Eileen was a psychologist all right .
Maybe he felt the same way .
I couldn't face Thelma after that night .
She never said a word about the fifty dollars .
That finished me with Thelma .
`` Who do you think pays the rent ? ?
Precious had me worried .
I couldn't make out what his racket was .
Still he let Eileen treat him like a valet .
I never could find out what his business was .
He always seemed to have money in his pocket .
Now and then he would disappear for several days .
Poor devil he can't have been too happy either .
She just wouldn't listen .
Eileen seemed to feel the same way .
We still had that much in common .
The trouble was drinking cost money .
Eileen must have wheedled a little out of Precious .
Pat O'Dwyer looked like a heavier Jim .
He was a big thick beefy violent man .
`` Whom God hath joined '' etcetera .
The O'Dwyers were real religious people except for Kate .
Pat meanwhile was bubbling over with sentiment .
Greatest thing that ever happened .
Pat had contacts all over the labor movement .
Most of them were elderly men .
For once radicalism was a recommendation .
Sposato couldn't wait to get me hired .
The things a man will do for a woman .
He sighed .
Hino was elated at the prospect .
He was to get involved in no arguments ; ;
he was to try to make no converts ; ;
He had already been studying the Bible ; ;
Rector was often curious ; ;
often tempted to ask questions but he never did .
`` Oh '' ? ?
Rector said .
`` I guess it will be all right .
"`` This afternoon '' , the secretary said ."
"`` All right '' , Rector said ."
`` I will be expecting them '' .
He had something more to say .
Rector laughed despite himself .
`` Arigato gosaimasu '' .
he wanted the mission compound to be effortlessly spotless .
A good initial impression would be important now .
Rector said .
`` Why '' ? ?
He said .
She looked back toward the schoolroom .
"`` Fifteen '' , she said ."
"`` No , only fourteen ."
The little Ito girl had had to go home .
She has a pretty bad cold '' .
Do you think you can manage it '' ? ?
Mavis smiled .
`` I'll try '' .
"'' `` Fine '' , Rector said ."
He looked out over the expanse of the compound .
`` Have you ever operated a transit '' ? ?
He said .
"`` No , sir '' , Johnson said ."
Konishi can help you .
You'll find an old transit in the basement .
Johnson nodded .
He said he could do it .
The fish took the bait .
She could act and she could write .
Have you any objection to the following plan ? ?
There we shall be free and unknown ; ;
we can return the following morning
And he would see her that evening .
Victory at last ! !
She had never sung better .
They passed close by the turn to Bishopsgate .
Alone with the fabulous Byron ! !
"How was she to behave , Claire wondered ."
Mystery -- that was the thing .
In the bedroom she would insist on darkness .
With his club foot he might well be grateful .
The fire in the sitting room was lighted .
`` What about the bedroom '' ? ?
Byron inquired .
"`` Sex is overpriced '' , he said ."
"That would be Minerva , I suppose ."
Wasn't the owl her symbol '' ? ?
Byron laughed .
`` I'll tell you nothing .
"Frankly , I don't care '' ."
She was striking the right note .
`` Byron '' ! !
She sprang up and went swiftly to the bedroom .
He drank slowly with due appreciation .
It was an excellent vintage .
He rose and went to the bedroom .
`` I am tired of sultans and scimitars '' .
`` How do you know that '' ? ?
Demanded Mary .
`` I promised him I wouldn't '' .
Chapter 9
Neither acknowledged the gift .
Only Mary's praise sustained him in his disappointment .
She understood completely .
`` How can you say such a thing ? ?
There are some even now .
"What about that dear , clever Mr. Thynne ? ?"
I am sure he is in raptures '' .
`` There are other Mr. Thynnes .
The lordly poet was at low-water mark .
Beckworth handed the pass to the colonel .
-- Beckworth .
-- Sir ? ?
"-- The last six months , sir ? ?"
-- You heard me .
There's a lot of waste going on here .
It's got to stop .
I want to take a look .
"This is no damned holiday , Beckworth ."
Get busy .
"-- Yes , sir ."
Beckworth left the tent .
He glanced back .
A crude ladder ran down to a wooden floor .
Two slits enabled observers to watch across the river .
The plank floor was slimed beneath Watson's boots .
Watson hardly looked at him .
He had peered through the darkness at the rampart .
-- We won't be too long .
"-- Yes , sir ."
He had acknowledged the man .
"It was easier to think now , Watson decided ."
But he groped blindly .
His lack of success steadily eroded his interest .
He was conscious of a growing sense of absurdity .
Wasn't the report official enough ? ?
What did he hope to accomplish here ? ?
For what ? ?
Watson snorted and then laughed aloud .
Exactly ! !
"-- 'scuse me , sir ."
-- Let's get out of here .
A soldier held the end of a frayed rope .
Watson stared at them curiously .
The crawling men tried to rise and fell again .
No one moved to them .
The third crawling man forced himself erect .
Watson looked for the fourth man .
He had reached the three passive guards ; ;
The guards did not look at him .
"The figure on the earth halted , seemingly bewildered ."
Then he began to crawl again .
Watson watched the creeping figure .
He felt a spectator interest .
Would the man make it or not ? ?
Say three minutes to make it sporting .
"The figure halted , and Watson gasped ."
The guards came to life with astonishing menace .
They spun and flung their rifles up .
Watson gesticulated wildly .
One man dropped to his knee for better aim .
Watson stared into a cadaverous face .
"The man's voice was a sweet , patient whisper ."
But you ain't Henry .
-- no .
-- It don't matter .
Is it far ? ?
-- Not far .
-- You talk deep .
Not like us fellas .
"It raises the voice , bein in camp ."
You Secesh ? ?
-- yes .
"Come on , now ."
Can you walk ? ?
"-- Why , course I can ."
I can walk real good .
Watson stumbled down the bank .
The man leaned his frail body against Watson's shoulder .
He was no heavier than a child .
Watson paused for breath .
His sweet whisper came after great effort .
"-- Oh , Christ ."
I wish you was Henry .
He promised to take me .
-- hush .
We're almost there .
He heard the patient voice calling .
-- Henry ? ?
"Where are you , Henry ? ?"
-- Make him lie down ! !
Watson snatched a deep breath .
He had not meant to shout .
He stood with his back to the skiff .
-- Goddamn you ! !
What do you do to them ? ?
Intelligence jabbed at him accusingly .
"He was angry , sickened ."
He had not felt that during the afternoon .
"No , nor later ."
"All his emotions had been inward , self-conscious ."
Yes .
That was it .
He was sure of it .
So Charles was dead .
What did it matter ? ?
His name had been crossed off a list .
Already his cool body lay in the ground .
What words had any meaning ? ?
What right had John to any special consideration ? ?
"Was John better , more deserving ? ?"
To hell with John .
John would curse .
He believed that brave boys didn't cry .
Watson spat on the ground .
He was grimly satisfied .
It would have been like her .
She was a pale woman .
Bomb Berlin ! !
It was the day to canvass for infectious hepatitis .
Mrs. Balcolm worked for the brain .
Mrs. Ten Eyke did mental health .
Mrs. Trenchard worked for the blind .
It was her destiny ; ;
it was her life .
But the Blevins were away ; ;
"`` Infectious hepatitis '' , he shouted heartily ."
The girlish voice was nearly a whisper .
"She was not a girl , he could see ."
"Where was Mr. Flannagan , he wondered ."
Travelling home on a late train ? ?
Changing his clothes upstairs ? ?
Taking a shower ? ?
Everything's on the table '' .
"`` Mr. Flannagan is away '' , she said ."
Her voice dropped .
`` Mr. Flannagan has been away for six weeks .
''
"All in all , they had six drinks ."
She described herself and her circumstances unhesitatingly .
Mr. Flannagan manufactured plastic tongue depressors .
He travelled all over the world .
She didn't like to travel .
She had no children ; ;
she had made no friends .
''
`` Where have you been '' ? ?
"Mrs. Pastern asked sadly , when he came in ."
`` It's after eleven '' .
`` I had a drink with the Flannagans '' .
`` She told me he was in Germany '' .
`` He came home unexpectedly '' .
`` Bomb them '' ! !
He shouted .
`` Throw a little nuclear hardware at them ! !
Show them who's boss '' ! !
But in bed he had trouble sleeping .
He loved them .
Her thoughts were not discrete .
"`` You remember them , I suppose '' ? ?"
I hope Raphael bought them whole '' .
Abel '' ? ?
She would have said triumph .
then she snorted and groped for her fork .
She was the last living of the older generation .
She ate .
"The girl , her first , she barely remembered ."
But the boy the boy had been alive yesterday .
They rarely spoke .
"That is what childhood is , he told himself ."
"Solid , settled lost ."
The small car flew on relentlessly .
Abel moved and adjusted his long legs .
"They've never met , you know ."
But Myra wouldn't budge without an express invitation .
I feel kind of bad about it '' .
Abel ignored the half-expressed bid for confirmation .
He smiled .
It was barely possible that his brother was right .
He could tell they were approaching the sea .
`` Remember the Starbird ? ?
"`` The Starbird , '' Abel said ."
They came unexpectedly upon the sea .
Oh he'd not care about the Pedersen kid .
"I pushed at his shoulder , calling his name ."
I couldn't be sure he was still asleep .
He was a cagey sonofabitch .
"`` Pap-pap-pap-hey '' , I said ."
I was leaning too far over .
I knew better .
Oh he was smart .
It put you off .
`` Get the hell out of here '' .
"It was better , though , he'd hit me ."
He was bitter when he missed .
`` Get the hell out of here '' .
`` Big Hans sent me .
He told me to wake you '' .
`` A fat hell on Big Hans .
Get out of here '' .
`` Get the hell out '' .
Pa pulled at the covers .
He was tasting his mouth .
`` The kid's froze good .
Hans is rubbing him with snow .
He's got him in the kitchen '' .
`` Pedersen '' ? ?
"`` No , Pa ."
It's the Pedersen kid .
The kid '' .
`` Nothing to steal from the crib '' .
"`` Not stealing , Pa ."
He was just lying there .
Hans found him froze .
That's where he was when Hans found him '' .
Pa laughed .
`` I ain't hid nothing in the crib '' .
"`` You don't understand , Pa ."
The Pedersen kid .
The kid '' --
`` I goddamn well understand '' .
`` I goddamn well understand .
You know I don't want to see Pedersen .
That cock .
Why should I ? ?
"What did he come for , hey ? ?"
"God dammit , get ."
And don't come back .
Find out something .
You're a fool .
Both you and Hans .
Pedersen .
That cock .
Don't come back .
Out .
Out '' .
He had long black hairs on his wrist .
They curled around the cuff of his nightshirt .
`` Big Hans made me come .
Big Hans said '' --
`` A fat hell on Big Hans .
He's an even bigger fool than you are .
"Fat , hey ? ?"
Out .
You want me to drop my pot '' ? ?
Then he threw things .
Pa'd been shit-sick in that pot .
Hans got an axe .
I heard Pa cursing all the way downstairs .
`` Ain't he going to wake up '' ? ?
`` What about your pa '' ? ?
`` He was awake when I left '' .
`` What'd he say ? ?
Did you get the whisky '' ? ?
`` Don't be smart .
Did you ask him about the whisky '' ? ?
`` Yeah '' .
`` Well '' ? ?
`` Don't be smart .
What's he going to do '' ? ?
`` Go back to sleep most likely '' .
`` You'd best get that whisky '' .
`` You go .
Take the axe .
Pa's scared to hell of axes '' .
This kid's froze bad .
You want the kid to die ? ?
Do you ? ?
`` Pa don't care about the kid '' .
`` Jorge '' .
`` Well he don't .
He don't care about anybody .
Get pig-drunk -- that's what he wants .
He don't care about nothing else at all .
Nothing .
Not Pedersen's kid neither .
That cock .
Not the kid neither '' .
"`` I'll get the spirits '' , Ma said ."
I'd wound Big Hans up tight .
Not any more .
Not for years .
"`` No you won't '' , Big Hans said ."
Hans rubbed the kid with more snow rubbed rubbed .
"`` I'll get more snow '' , I said ."
I don't know where Ma went .
There was no way of getting even .
It wasn't like getting cheated at the fair .
Ma had found one of Pa's hiding places .
Pa had a knack for hiding .
He knew we were looking and he enjoyed it .
But now Ma .
Pa was sure to find out .
A fool could see what was going on .
He took pride in his hiding .
It was all the pride he had .
I guess fooling Hans and me took doing .
But he didn't figure Ma for much .
Hans poured some in a tumbler .
`` No '' .
`` Why not ? ?
`` Not where he's froze good .
Heat's bad for frostbite .
He's got to thaw slow .
You ought to know that '' .
Colors on the towels had run .
Ma poked her toe in the kid's clothes .
"`` Here , help me prop him up ."
I got hold his mouth open '' .
"`` Come on , Jorge '' ."
`` All right '' .
"`` Lift , don't shove lift '' ."
"`` O.K. , I'm lifting '' ."
I took him by the shoulders .
His head flopped back .
His mouth fell open .
The skin on his neck was tight .
He was cold all right .
`` Hold his head up .
He'll choke '' .
`` His mouth is open '' .
`` His throat's shut .
He'll choke '' .
`` He'll choke anyway '' .
`` Hold his head up '' .
`` I can't '' .
`` Don't hold him like that .
Put your arms around him '' .
`` Well Jesus '' .
He was cold all right .
I put my arm carefully around him .
Hans had his fingers in the kid's mouth .
`` Now he'll choke for sure '' .
`` Shut up .
Just hold him like I told you '' .
"He was cold all right , and wet ."
I had my arm behind his back .
it was always the same unqualified success now .
But he was not bored at all ; ;
an explosive laugh which always carried everything before it .
He would settle himself into his seat to laugh .
Whenever he laughed it was all he was doing .
improvise cha-chas on the harp ; ;
Enjoy being a bride while you can '' .
"Without saying so , she was really grateful ; ;"
So the pattern was established .
And sit on the porch a while .
The women and children stayed at the Albrights' .
"There was much embracing , much exclaiming ."
`` Cousin Ada ! !
Cousin John '' ! !
`` Cousin Lura '' ! !
`` Cousin Howard '' ! !
`` And how is she '' ? ?
We came on as soon as we could '' .
`` And who is this '' ? ?
"He asked , when she passed him a glass ."
"`` Let's see '' , Cousin Ada said ."
"`` Oh yes '' , Mama laughed ."
`` He's ten years younger than Ernest .
We didn't expect him to come along ; ;
thought for the longest he was a tumor '' .
"`` Who is Howard , anyway '' ? ?"
She asked Bobby Joe that night .
`` He makes me uncomfortable '' .
`` Oh he's a second cousin or something .
`` How old is he '' ? ?
"`` Gosh , I don't know ."
"Thirty-five , I guess ."
He's been married and got this half-grown kid .
He's just a big windbag '' .
Bobby Joe was thinking about something else .
Linda Kay asked .
`` Who '' ? ?
`` Howard '' .
"`` Hell , I don't know ."
When he was a kid I wasn't around '' .
Howard sighed .
"`` You lucky kids '' , he said ."
Then he told Linda Kay about himself .
It made her feel different about Howard .
`` Cook a whole antelope '' ? ?
She exclaimed .
I never even saw any '' .
"`` Oh , you could ."
Alex asked .
He placed it on Alex's lap .
All search was ended ; ;
he had found his fowl .
Their hostess enquired .
`` Comment '' ? ?
the audience attended .
"`` Who was that , young feller '' ? ?"
The doctor instantly asked .
"She looked mighty interested , though ."
`` Have you got our keys handy '' ? ?
`` Right in my pocket '' .
`` All right .
The hall was empty and Alex beckoned ; ;
A guest was locking his room ; ;
"`` Leave me alone '' , Leona said ."
`` Can't you see I'm busy '' ? ?
Leona '' ! !
His eye had fastened on her leg ; ;
"bending , he touched her knee ."
She twitched her leg away .
"`` Fuss , fuss , old man '' ."
She had an alley cat's manners .
fine hand .
"Sighing , Leona dropped the paper and stood up ."
Winston watched her fumbling to untie her apron .
`` Here '' .
"Carefully , he undid the bow ."
She turned and put her arms around his neck .
`` Now listen to that '' .
"He drew back , embarrassed and pleased ."
`` I don't mean Miss Ada ! !
What you think I care about that ? ?
I mean our children '' .
She sounded as though they already existed .
All the time in the world .
"We've only been married four years , January '' ."
`` Four years '' ! !
She wailed .
"`` That's a long time , waiting '' ."
He hardly believed his reason himself any more .
He asked Leona .
"She was too young , that was all ; ;"
too young and thin and straight .
`` Winston '' ! !
Winston hurried through the swinging door .
`` This coat looks like a rag heap '' .
He gave Mr. Jack a real going-over ; ;
`` Hey '' ! !
Winston apologized and quickly set the hat right .
Winston enjoyed seeing him start out ; ;
he wore his clothes with style .
`` Look out for those movers '' ! !
Winston had been surprised at her for that .
In a week the hyacinths would spike out .
and after that the Japanese cherries .
where would she go for her gardening now ? ?
Somehow Winston didn't think she'd take to window boxes .
"Sighing , he hurried to the living room ."
He had a thousand things to see to .
the snail is pulling in her horns .
She was looking out at the garden .
Miss Ada was looking fine ; ;
"Frowning , Miss Ada studied the list ."
"`` Well , let's see ."
The china lemon tree .
The alabaster cockatoo '' .
Neither of them trusted the movers .
Winston folded the tissue paper carefully .
`` He's used it every day ; ;
"`` Well , that's over now ."
And it was his main present ! !
Winston laid it in the basket .
`` Mr. Jack sets store by that '' .
"`` Really , Winston ."
It was meant to be my present '' .
But she went on down the list .
Winston was relieved ; ;
those presents had been on his mind .
`` Picture ! !
You mean picture of me '' ? ?
But Winston had persuaded him .
Finally she had come down ; ;
`` How do you like it '' ? ?
She had asked .
`` Is that a compliment '' ? ?
`` I don't know '' .
"`` Lovie , you make me feel naked '' ."
"`` Not a line , not a wrinkle ."
"`` Look , an old man ."
Will you wear pink when you're sixty '' ? ?
"`` Darling , I love that photograph ."
I'm going to put it on my dresser '' .
`` I guess it's children make a woman old .
A man gets old anyhow '' .
`` No .
Was it love ? ?
I had no doubt that it was .
These letters became the center of my existence .
She was terribly pleased .
Her optimism gave me heart .
I forced confidence into myself .
I set the hour of our meeting for seven .
His neighbors cheered him on .
There was a great sense of camaraderie .
How did one join them ? ?
Where were they all walking to ? ?
I looked away .
Where exactly would we go after the movie ? ?
Suppose I hadn't brought along enough money ? ?
I felt for my wallet .
"Its thick , substantial outline calmed me ."
I grew uneasy .
My heart almost stopped beating .
This had worried her .
`` Why do you say that '' ? ?
I asked .
Nonsense ! !
Don't tell me about drunks .
You're not the kind to go violent .
Were you in love with that girl '' ? ?
"She met my eyes , suddenly angry ."
"`` You what , Mary Jane '' ? ?"
Was she pretty '' ? ?
`` Why should I ? ?
I've worked this ward for three months now .
You've treated your stay here like a big joke .
"I wanted to go to college , too '' --"
`` Why didn't you '' ? ?
I asked .
`` Chicago has some of the best '' --
Her eyes flashed angrily .
`` You don't seem to know much about reality .
I'm the oldest of six children .
Nurses' training here doesn't cost anything .
They even pay me six dollars a month .
I think it's a good deal .
`` Do you have a boy friend '' ? ?
I asked .
`` My aunt raised me .
"`` I'm sorry '' , she said ."
We've always been so close '' .
`` Tell me more about them '' .
When she had finished I said :
"He's a pretty good judge of character , Anderson ."
`` What about you ? ?
`` Do you like to dance ? ?
They always have a good orchestra '' .
I knew that .
It was a fantastic story .
a figment of Carl Anderson's imagination .
Four
Such optimism was completely unjustified .
The critics literally screamed their indignation .
We opened on Friday and closed the following Monday .
The telephone rang .
"`` All right '' , I said ."
"`` I beg your pardon , sir '' ? ?"
`` All right .
This is Dale Nelson the actor '' .
`` Good .
Could you possibly have lunch with him today ? ?
I smiled .
"`` Yes , of course , Mr. Nelson '' ."
They all bowed low as I approached them .
I walked over to him .
`` You Mr. Nelson '' ? ?
He asked .
`` That's right '' .
I was giving the parked cars the once-over .
I walked with him back to the entrance .
I was back in ten minutes .
"`` That's right '' , I told him ."
Can you find it all right '' ? ?
"`` Sure '' , I told him ."
I always keep a set in the car .
The attendant waved me on .
You want to sit down .
Your leg muscles and back muscles feel weary .
He came out alone .
`` It's a sublease .
"`` Okay '' , I told him ."
`` I'm in a rush right now .
I know where the car is .
Want me to drive it out '' ? ?
`` It's one of the rules on transients .
Regulars drive out their own cars '' .
I asked .
`` You're going to be a regular .
You'll get in the office building here .
By the time I'd made it he was gone .
Traffic was pretty heavy .
That meant he'd parked someplace .
By this time it was dark .
I remembered it was the Peeping Tom place .
I could have written anything .
`` That's right '' .
`` I don't think so '' .
"It's a formality , you know '' ."
`` Any difference in the rate '' ? ?
I asked .
"`` Not to you '' , she said smiling ."
`` It's ten dollars either way .
We like to run a nice quiet place '' .
"`` Thank you '' , I told her ."
The construction was reasonably solid ; ;
She knew where to come .
He didn't have to telephone .
She asked .
"`` I'm in a hurry , Beautiful '' ."
There's lots of time left '' .
That's when my evening commences '' .
"`` Oh , you ! !"
'' She announced .
`` That's what they all say .
I didn't turn it off '' .
Then I shut off the device again .
She wanted to hang around while I was eating .
"`` No '' , I said ."
`` It's a kindness to her .
"You see , she's on a diet ."
`` How much overweight is she '' ? ?
She looked at me provocatively .
The gun moved .
"The thin man said , `` That-a-way '' ."
`` -- second building on the right '' .
Roberta and Dave began to back toward the door .
The thin man waved the gun again .
"He said , `` Right around the corner '' ."
`` A night policeman just like in the States .
You know '' ? ?
Roberta glanced up at her husband .
She decided to risk it .
She tore open the back door .
Slowly she turned to face the men again .
Rat-face at the counter was on his feet .
The gun followed her .
It was getting light .
Vince .
Got it '' ? ?
The white Buick hadn't moved away yet .
Good .
"He said , `` Grosse ? ?"
"`` I ain't kidding you , Vince ."
How could she ? ?
`` Howda I know '' ? ?
Kinda like a zombie ? ?
Vince swore .
but he was aware of it just the same .
Vince cursed steadily .
Vince watched him .
The fat man didn't answer .
He spoke soothingly .
`` She don't know nothing about them cars .
She thinks she's in a ordinary garage '' .
"`` How do you know , stupid ? ?"
And put Cate's gun back '' .
`` I know '' .
Grosse tucked the gun under the counter .
`` Who's telling Guardino '' ? ?
Vince swore again .
The fat man winced .
Grosse spread his hands .
In the tool crib she can't get away '' .
Grosse swore now .
"`` Dammit all , Vince ."
I ain't no baby sitter '' .
He spoke sullenly .
`` You don't hafta get nasty .
Suddenly he grinned .
His voice lost its sullen tones and he chuckled .
`` I got one question '' .
`` What is it '' ? ?
Impatiently .
Grosse ducked and sniggered .
`` Where'd you say you was born '' ? ?
`` In a Chicago slum just like you .
Lauren Landis rubbed her face against the blanket .
She had cried a little because she was frightened .
Was it because she had shown panic ? ?
Who could blame her for that ? ?
She was glad the fat man had left .
Barney was not really frightening .
She smiled at him wetly .
He placed a bottle opener on the counter .
"So , he understood her panic ."
It was icy cold and tasted delicious .
She felt a lift in spirit .
When she was finished she pushed it back .
"She called softly , `` Barney '' ."
He looked in her direction but he didn't answer .
Still no answer .
I could send the money right back '' .
Barney finished the cigarette he had been smoking .
Now he looked at her .
"He said , `` I only work here '' ."
"Lauren said , `` Please '' ? ?"
But he was back at work on a car .
Her heart was thumping painfully ; ;
Something wet and hot was trickling on her wrists .
Tears ? ?
"Her mother and father , for instance ."
Where were they now ? ?
This is the end of the line '' .
Lauren Landis was in trouble and she was alone .
"Somewhere birds were sweetly calling , were answered ."
`` Dave .
I saw that woman's apron behind the door .
Dave made some sound meant to convey agreement .
He inserted the car key in the lock .
Roberta was violently trembling .
Why don't we drive around the corner '' ? ?
The car door crashed shut .
The engine throbbed into life .
"Dave said , `` I got the message ."
We're going '' .
"Roberta said , `` no ."
You go .
Walk .
Suppose Lauren comes looking for us ? ?
Roberta glanced at him and stopped trembling .
His jowls were spiked by barbs of graying beard .
Marty recognized the man .
He looked straight at Marty .
He did not answer .
`` Did anyone see my cab '' ? ?
"He asked , keeping his voice casual ."
`` I see there are some cars here .
And then a startling thing occurred .
Yet the men all moved at the same instant .
In seconds all four cars were out of sight .
Land looked back toward the dilapidated house .
Perhaps it was Dora May .
There were other farmhouses nearby .
There were many more between here and Jarrodsville .
Telephone poles lined the road .
They reared tall and mocking .
Their wires stretched out into infinity .
There was nothing he could do but walk .
Then he realized the utter futility of the idea .
Even the eyes of the smallest children seemed malicious .
"They , too , stared at him ."
The drums of thunder were right behind him now .
A foolish thought came into his head .
The fencing by the roadside ended .
It was coming toward him .
The car was now in sight .
Marty's heart skipped a beat when he recognized it .
Acey Squire's station wagon .
It had headed back toward Jarrodsville .
Then there was another sound .
Marty looked helplessly in both directions .
They bore down on him .
He still had three miles to go .
He could not go through the fields .
The Admassy place could not be far now .
"He stood , panting , for a moment ."
He lost all sense of dignity .
He had to reach Admassy's place .
It was his only sanctuary .
The fences stretched on endlessly .
And then he heard them .
And now he saw them .
They had timed it better this time .
He stopped stone-still .
They thundered at him .
He forced himself to stay frozen there .
He did not leave the middle of the road .
He did not try to run .
He was nearing the Admassy house .
`` Not again so soon '' .
It was the sound of a siren .
It was the prowl car from the sheriff's office .
The car drew up alongside him and stopped .
"`` Get in '' , Charley Estes said brusquely ."
There was someone in front with the sheriff .
"It was Pete Holmes , the cabdriver ."
But there wasn't no use in me staying there .
I couldn't fight a dozen or so of 'em .
Why didn't you wait at the Burch house ? ?
You must've known I'd gone to get the sheriff .
This is redneck country .
"`` About an hour , eh ? ?"
Are you positive '' ? ?
Want to try and meet him there '' ? ?
Shayne looked at his watch .
I'll be there '' .
`` I hope to Christ .
''
`` Where '' ? ?
`` It's out in the Northeast section .
Have you got my car here '' ? ?
`` It's parked in front '' .
`` A lady .
He opened the door and followed Rourke out .
`` I haven't the faintest idea .
Isn't this Felice's street '' ? ?
Not more than a block or so '' .
On the right '' .
`` It was back there .
''
His voice was chilling and cold .
`` I didn't notice it .
I was watching for numbers .
''
"`` It has a Beach license , Tim ."
Two men in the front seat .
A couple named Harris and Geely .
Those names mean anything to you '' ? ?
"`` Wait a minute , Mike ."
In Painter's office this evening .
''
Shayne nodded grimly .
`` What are they doing here '' ? ?
"`` A stake-out , I suppose ."
On Felice Perrin .
"I'm not positive , Tim ."
I may be wrong .
Make them show their hands .
"`` The things you talk me into , Mike ."
''
Shayne chuckled .
You should complain '' .
Harris and Geely .
Take your time with your drink .
I'll beat it .
Be excited and don't identify yourself .
I'll be waiting for you there '' .
`` We sure don't '' .
"Three minutes , Tim '' ."
He didn't stir .
`` Sure .
Said they'd have a patrol car here fast .
Let's get inside .
What happened with you '' ? ?
Shayne found one marked Perrin Aj .
I wouldn't have to tell them I had Roberts --
"He rose stiffly , forcing his knees to lock ."
"`` Come on '' , he said ."
He held the razor well out to one side .
Mickey waited with slack arms .
"`` Any time , Roberts '' , he said ."
The taunt was lost on Roberts .
"The kick came , sudden and vicious but short ."
Roberts sagged and slashed at him wildly .
They were in the center of the lobby now .
When he charged Mickey was ready .
He couldn't feel any .
Roberts appeared to be dead ; ;
"if not yet , then soon , very soon ."
Suddenly it was cold in the lobby .
12
They would have to .
There's no other way ; ;
I'll have to do it myself .
Mickey was sure now he was dead .
Only me .
He left a few things .
It didn't have to be perfect .
Roberts was a wastrel .
It took him nearly an hour .
He was mildly surprised to find it was snowing .
He put it in his own pocket for safekeeping .
Then he went back for Roberts .
The body was heavier than he had anticipated .
"It snowed continuously , but quietly , evenly ."
It wasn't like carrying the suitcase .
The soft snow was deceitful underfoot .
Twice he nearly fell .
It would be a bad place to die .
It was too late to worry about that .
It hung momentarily on the point of dropping off .
"Deep enough , he decided ."
By spring it would be a skeleton .
He made his way back to the Jeep .
That courtyard picture with the same initials '' .
I'll call you in a day or so '' .
He checked into a motel and drove downtown .
The sheriff's swivel chair tilted back .
Pity we don't know more about him .
`` That's an idea .
He smiled .
She'd also remember if the groom died later '' .
He stood up .
`` Last year ? ?
"Well , I do remember one ."
From Baton Rouge .
Married a man named Vincent Black .
`` What reason did she give '' ? ?
`` Was her name Lisa Carmody '' ? ?
`` Never mind .
I can look it up .
Do they still live here '' ? ?
I'm sure it'll be in the files .
He stood up and thanked her .
She asked with a reportorial gleam in her eye .
"Mr. Ferrell is a private detective , Hirey ."
"`` Sure '' , said Hirey ."
`` I'll just leave the door open .
He pulled it open .
`` Now don't shut this door .
It won't open from inside .
Hank thanked them and promised to observe the rules .
Chapter fourteen
From reconstruction to moon rockets .
He staggered over and dropped it on the table .
No mention of New Orleans .
Now for their exodus from Gulf Springs .
He found it in the edition of May 15 .
The air conditioner was no longer running .
It clanged shut as he sprang toward it .
He pressed his face against the grille .
`` Who's there '' ? ?
Then he heard the outer door closing .
"`` Hey , come back '' , he shouted ."
But why ? ?
To search his room at the motel ? ?
`` Well '' -- said Mr. Skyros .
It was awkward : very awkward .
Someone reasonably trustworthy .
And Angie would hear about it .
And Angie knew --
No trouble .
the genial smile seemed painted on his face .
Angie knew -- Speak of dangerous information ! !
Angie knew too much entirely already .
Really he had Mr. Skyros at bay
`` Big favor I done you .
`` This deal with the ace o' spades .
"All about that Angie knew , too ."
he found money much more interesting ; ;
I stay in business so long because I'm careful .
"`` That's a long while '' , said Angie ."
I can't wait no two weeks '' .
Angelo gave him an affectionate smile .
And all because of Domokous ! !
"Of course , there was another factor ."
"Who knew , Angie might not last long ."
He patted Angelo's thin shoulder paternally .
"You don't need worry , Angelo ."
"`` I appreciate it , you do that ."
Sure .
We don't none of us want no trouble .
Or maybe I call you -- tonight ? ?
"`` Sure '' , said Angie ."
"`` Sure , Mr. Skyros ."
"Fifty a throw , that the deal ? ?"
Sure .
"`` Standard deal , Mr. Skyros ."
But I do my best for you '' .
It could all be straightened out later .
After this deal with the Bouvardier woman went through .
An ace of spades .
"Grab , snatch , I saw that first ! !"
This kind of place
"Off at noon , and she'd never come back ."
Never have to .
"Money -- a lot of money , enough ."
Not when she'd waited so long already .
A better life .
Escape .
It wasn't as if she wanted much .
"Prettier , she'd do her hair another way ; ;"
`` Think I can't count '' ? ?
Katya made up the amount in indifferent silence .
"Some of those vaguely-imagined new , different people ."
"Soon , very soon now"
sixteen
Mendoza didn't wake until nearly nine-thirty .
It was going to be another hot day ; ;
already the thermometer stood close to ninety .
Alison was still sound asleep ; ;
`` Y que sigue despues ? ?
-- What then '' ? ?
He asked her severely .
I wonder if the Carters would take one .
Maude's long nose unexpectedly wrinkled up .
`` Happened to be in the hall ! !
Happened to hear you quarrel about her ! !
"Oh , well , you can't really blame Lolotte ."
She lost her beau to you '' .
Sarah remembered it clearly .
Maude went on .
`` I've got to get busy .
Drink your coffee '' --
coffee .
`` It's -- cold '' .
`` Oh .
`` I forgot .
Ben and Lucien have gone after them .
`` I don't know Mrs. Stowe .
`` They can't do anything .
I told Ben so .
He didn't even know that she was there .
Then somebody else ? ?
That was not reasonable either .
That made a certain amount of logic .
No .
It was merely an attempt to frighten her .
she wouldn't run like a scared cat .
"But -- well , she'd be very careful ."
Rev had known all along .
He could conceivably have wished to make sure ; ;
Rev had stressed the need for money .
She thrust the envelope back in the bag ; ;
"`` Well , then who brought it '' ? ?"
`` Miss Maude .
Glendora put down a dish of lukewarm rice .
`` Not much breakfast this morning .
Maude ? ?
Glendora flapped away .
In the kitchen Glendora was despairingly picking chickens .
"`` Get a basket '' , Sarah told her ."
`` We'll go to the storehouse '' .
Sarah found the right key and unlocked the door .
It was dark but dry and cool .
"They wouldn't go hungry , not yet ."
And the fields were green and growing .
Maude had said .
Maude .
She couldn't see how her death could affect Maude .
"Rev , George and Lolotte were mending shoes ."
George had a tack hammer .
"`` With boots on '' , Lolotte laughed softly ."
Rev looked up and saw her .
Lolotte looked up and stiffened .
George didn't look up at all .
"Rev said , `` Come in , Sarah ."
Reckon you know the news '' .
Rev's face was suddenly a little fixed and questioning .
He turned to George and Lolotte .
`` Take your cobbler's shop somewhere else .
I want to talk to Sarah '' .
A rush of panic caught Sarah .
`` No .
Not now .
Glendora '' --
Now why did I do that ? ?
"She was no schoolgirl , refusing to bear tales ."
So she couldn't choose Rev as a confidant ; ;
it must be Lucien .
Glendora gave a gulp .
Miss Maude say she won't '' .
`` Not since last night .
I didn't think there was any reason to '' .
`` Maybe there isn't .
Speak to him again anyway .
You might try looking into his wife too .
`` Yeah .
`` Then again he might not '' .
"`` What a stinking world '' , Rourke said ."
`` Black is Gilborn's best friend '' .
`` I know '' .
`` Will you be coming back soon '' ? ?
`` I think so .
`` Gilborn's secretary ? ?
What for ? ?
You don't think Gilborn is the -- '' ? ?
`` I don't think anything .
Conrad interrupted .
I'd like to make sure .
`` Right .
I'll see you later '' .
He looked at his watch .
It was ten minutes before eleven .
But he still wanted to know why .
"After leaving Conrad , Gilborn had no destination ."
"As he walked , he tried to think ."
Of Kitti .
Of himself .
There was nothing coherent about his thinking .
Conrad's words had intellectual meaning for him only .
"Emotionally , they penetrated him not at all ."
Whoever he was and your wife were intimate .
Gilborn remembered Conrad's exact words .
They made sense and yet they didn't .
He knew Conrad had told him the truth .
It was so .
Yet it wasn't so .
It wasn't so because it couldn't be so .
Kitti had come along to justify everything .
"She was his goal , she was his reason ."
He had lived all his life waiting for her .
He could not consider it now .
Not really .
"And so he walked , aimless again ."
He looked at Gilborn with undisguised curiosity .
Gilborn passed by him without seeing him .
"In the apartment itself , all was still ."
The police were no longer there .
Except that Kitti wasn't there .
Who ? ?
Who ? ?
Someone had taken her away from him .
Who ? ?
Who ? ?
Whoever he was and your wife were intimate .
"Quickly , he went into the bedroom ."
Gilborn stood there for a long time .
He looked at the bed unblinkingly .
The bed was empty now .
Kitti would lie in it no more .
He would lie in it no more .
"For thirty minutes , Stanley Gilborn stood there ."
Who ? ?
He could think of no answer .
Gilborn put on his coat again .
He knew he would never see it again .
She wondered whether Stanley would call .
He hadn't .
Why hadn't he called ? ?
Stanley really was quite predictable .
He wasn't like so many other men .
"The dentist last night , for instance ."
Dinner and the movies had been fine .
He had taken her upstairs to say good night .
She had invited him in for coffee .
But he hadn't understood .
Stanley wasn't like that .
Except for that one morning .
She thought she was going to die .
She was thirty-one years old then .
"As a result , he never looked for it ."
"Unquestionably , Blanche loved Stanley ."
"And then , unexpectedly , Stanley made his announcement ."
Kitti could have married a score of men .
He hadn't come back for over two .
It was too unprecedented .
She stayed away for ten days .
"Mostly , she stayed in bed ."
"`` Right '' , said the fingerprint man ."
Felix was the exception .
Just put yourself in Felix's place for a moment .
"You're a taxpayer , householder , landlord ."
Maybe one could be startled into forgetfulness .
You identify yourself and ask him what's going on .
"`` Got the upstairs guy '' , he bellows ."
`` The owner .
Do I send him up '' ? ?
Then he turns back to you .
"`` Go on in '' , he says ."
`` They'll tell you what's cooking '' .
Our man stopped dead and glowered at Felix .
This was a bull of a man .
"He was big-chested , big-shouldered and heavy-armed ."
It was almost as white as his teeth .
His eyes were clear .
Not even a whiff .
Eventually he subsided .
`` Felix '' ? ?
Gibby said .
"`` Me '' , he said merrily ."
"`` Me , the happy one '' ."
"`` I try '' , Felix said blithely ."
I've never noticed that it improves things any '' .
"`` Bully for you '' , Gibby said ."
`` What's the rest of your name '' ? ?
`` No rest of it .
Felix is all there is '' .
`` All there ever was '' ? ?
`` You live in the present '' ? ?
"`` In the present '' , Felix proclaimed ."
`` For the future .
We are Assistant District Attorneys .
This gentleman is a police officer .
He is a fingerprint specialist .
The happy one could never have looked happier .
This was more than joy .
It was ecstasy .
"`` Those lovely whorls '' , he chortled ."
"`` So intricate , so beautiful ."
Come right along .
I love fingerprints '' .
Gibby called him back .
"`` Past , yes , but important ."
`` That important '' ? ?
Felix asked .
`` That important '' .
"`` Grubb '' , Felix whispered ."
`` Felix Grubb '' ? ?
"Gibby asked , not bothering to whisper ."
"`` Shh '' , Felix implored ."
Obligingly Gibby lowered his voice .
`` Felix Grubb '' ? ?
He repeated .
`` No .
"Edmund , but not for years ."
For years it's been just Felix .
That was almost forty years ago '' .
We followed him up the stairs .
Felix took us into his studio .
None of his movements was tentative .
There was no process of trial and error .
They were all completely shrouded .
There were tools about but they were neatly kept .
There was no confusion and no litter .
Supplies of sheet metal were neatly stacked in bins .
Andy did not see the newspapers the next day .
Outside his window bloomed a beautiful summer day .
But where ? ?
He snapped to alertness at Andy's entrance .
"`` Sorry , Mr. Paxton ."
Nothing new .
`` Reporters '' ? ?
`` Our own people .
Questions about the show tonight '' .
Hub picked up the telephone .
`` I suppose .
"How's Lissa , do you know '' ? ?"
Hub considered .
`` Some better .
"She's got plenty of guts , Mr. Paxton ."
You want me to call her '' ? ?
`` She expecting me to '' ? ?
they had nothing to give to each other .
"He had little time to himself , anyway ."
Thornburg arrived with the writers .
He asked if there was anything he could do .
"But from Rocco Vecchio , they heard nothing ."
At last it was time to depart .
El Dorado was surrounded by a mob .
They had come not to admire but to observe .
"`` It's worse inside '' , Thornburg informed Andy ."
`` Skolman's jammed in every table he could find .
Backstage was tomblike by contrast .
It was signed by everyone in the troupe .
Andy couldn't help but be touched .
Andy gathered that this had been no small accomplishment .
Bake himself looked better ; ;
any kind of job was better than brooding .
I wouldn't want him to miss the message '' .
`` I'll try .
It's those damn loudspeakers '' .
`` What about them '' ? ?
`` They're going to louse me up good .
Andy sighed .
"`` Sure , I know ."
But it's such a long shot '' --
`` No longer than yours .
Andy crumbled the script in his fist .
"But don't try to stop me , either '' ."
I can hardly wait '' .
"But Bonner departed , still full of ill will ."
"he had to cling to routine , tested procedures ."
To act otherwise would be to admit his helplessness .
"But , admit or not , Bonner was helpless ."
Andy's performance was scheduled for eleven o'clock .
Bake cursed .
You about ready '' ? ?
`` What's he complaining about '' ? ?
Bake asked .
"`` They're drinking , aren't they '' ? ?"
`` No .
We got a bunch of sippers out there tonight .
"Hub , you stick by the stage door ."
He may try to phone us '' .
Following him .
They were right .
Here's where luck would normally step in .
Their clapping grew more fervent ; ;
The worst was yet to come .
Andy felt his heart thud heavily with relief .
The music died away discordantly .
He drew a deep breath .
Nor could he blame them .
`` Lullaby and goodnight .
''
His voice shook .
He wondered if the audience would let him finish .
They did ; ;
"though contemptuous , they were still polite ."
Someone clapped tentatively then quickly stopped .
"Otherwise , the silence was complete ."
He stumbled off-stage .
"`` My God '' , he muttered ."
`` My God '' .
Hub was there to support him .
"`` It's okay , Mr. Paxton ."
"The money's here , all of it '' ."
`` Did you hear them ? ?
"`` Bunch of damn jerks '' , Hub growled ."
`` Who needs them '' ? ?
Thornburg patted his arm .
"`` Sure , Andy , it'll be all right ."
Nothing broken that can't be mended '' .
The words were hollow .
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Vecchio shouldered in .
"`` I got it , Andy ."
"God knows how , but I got it ."
You'll never believe the places I've been today .
Andy nodded dully .
"`` It doesn't matter , Rock ."
We've done our part '' .
The usual congratulatory crowd was conspicuously absent ; ;
the place had the air of a morgue .
`` Dad .
"Dad , wait '' ."
"`` Just this one favor , Dad ."
`` Why not '' ? ?
`` It's the truth '' .
Why won't you accept facts ? ?
His father looked him over closely .
`` You sound like an old woman .
"`` Now , see here '' --"
Mrs. Holden turned from the window draperies .
She stood frowning and chewing her lip .
`` I think you had better come home '' .
"`` Mae , we're so busy ."
`` I don't care .
I want you here .
His voice grew high and trembling .
They'll they'll think I did something '' .
`` You'll just have to risk it .
"They found some clothes '' , she tossed in ."
`` What '' ? ?
"Deliberately , she ignored the yelp ."
"`` Also , that Mr. Ferguson was here ."
I guess he wants to ask you some questions .
I stalled him off .
He doesn't expect you until five '' .
`` Then I'd better wait until five '' .
`` No-o-o .
Come home right away '' .
Her eyes were bright with anticipation .
He rose from his chair .
He had to cough then ; ;
He got his hat out of the closet .
He got into the car .
What did she think he could do ? ?
her motives were too blatant .
She wanted him to get into trouble .
"Nothing bald , open ; ;"
but enough .
They'd have some suspicions to repeat to the police .
It hadn't amounted to anything .
Suppose the cops somehow got hold of that ? ?
He hadn't touched her .
"Too monstrous , of course ."
Mae wouldn't have plotted a thing like that .
Like this murder .
He felt light-headed and sick .
Mae was his wife .
She wouldn't be wilfully planning his destruction .
But she was .
She was .
But he couldn't imagine where .
"At the gate he slowed , looking around ."
he didn't even look up .
Holden stepped on the gas .
A new idea drifted in from nowhere .
He could go to the police .
He was sure of this .
It would be such a relief .
"Sure , they're giving up hope ."
Good-bye .
Holden waved a hand at the empty street .
Glad to see you go .
He looked up and down the street .
`` Mae '' --
And then you wiped up some grease '' .
`` No .
Wait a minute .
What do you '' --
Or even yesterday .
The police have them now '' .
`` I don't remember any overalls at all '' .
`` They were all faded .
Worn through at the knees '' .
She stood sipping and chewing and watching .
"`` Green paint , wasn't it ? ?"
"Well , I'm not sure of the color ."
But you had them '' .
"`` Mae , sit down ."
Put down the cup of coffee .
Tell me what this is all about '' .
She shook her head .
She took another bite of toast .
A seeping coldness entered Holden's being ; ;
`` I've never owned any painting overalls .
Or are the eyebrows more like this '' ? ?
"Different about the mouth , huh ? ?"
"More like this , maybe '' ? ?"
But Gardner Willings was not included ; ;
"With names and addresses listed , verification came next ."
It would take time ; ;
"it would , almost inevitably , trouble some water ."
He's in Boston .
Of course he's in '' -- )
The King Arthur was less expensive than the Dumont .
Check the overnighters out .
Anybody carrying anything that might hide a rifle ? ?
Long thin suitcase ? ?
"Or long fat suitcase , for that matter ? ?"
Who measures ? ?
"Cases , say , for musical instruments ? ?"
None noted at the Dumont .
Several at the King Arthur .
A combo was staying there .
And had been for a week .
Anything else ? ?
Anything at all ? ?
Shrugs met that .
Traces of oil on green tissue ? ?
The lab to check .
The lab : sorry .
No oil .
)
Anything at all strange ? ?
Mullins came in .
Must have cost plenty .
pass word when there was word to pass .
Weigand tossed this news into the centrifuge .
"Sort things out , damn it ."
Sort out the next move .
Try to forget motive for the moment .
Consider opportunity .
The Norths ; ;
"Hathaway , Jerry's publicity director ; ;"
"Livingston Birdwood , producer of Uprising ."
Take Gardner Willings .
He had left after the scuffle ; ;
had been seen to leave .
"Consider him seriously , therefore ? ?"
"Willings would ambush , certainly ; ;"
Willings undoubtedly had .
To be checked out further .
Forget motive ? ?
"No , motive is a part of fact ."
Nobody in his right mind punishes a quarter-century-old dereliction .
Bill shook his head .
Lauren herself ? ?
( Check on the Payne luggage .
) She might now have taken it away again .
Motive -- her husband wandering ? ?
"Bitter , unreasoning jealousy ? ?"
Heaven knew it happened and hell knew it too .
( Call it mentally young ; ;
call it retarded .
She did not move in primitive circles .
"She was young , but not that young ."
He reminded himself that all eliminations were tentative .
Opportunity was obvious .
Motive .
"With the boy , particularly ."
Bill picked up the telephone ; ;
got Mullins .
`` Right '' ? ?
Mullins would do .
Which probably would turn out to be true ; ;
He might deny the latter ; ;
He would have to be given the opportunity .
Mullins ? ?
Let Mullins keep the firm seat ; ;
let Stein .
"`` All right '' , Pam said ."
`` I know it isn't dinnertime '' .
Martha presumably would cope .
She might be firm .
It was most unlikely that she would be firm .
And possessed himself -- how ? ?
-- of a rifle and killed ? ?
Pam found she had no answers ; ;
had only a hope .
"The poor kid -- the poor , frail kid ."
"The poor , unlucky --"
The telephone rang .
At four o'clock in the afternoon .
Two martinis for lunch -- that was the trouble .
I ought to remember .
Don't pretend .
You do remember .
You just -- `` Hello ? ?
"Yes , this is she ? ?"
What '' ? ?
The voice had music in it .
"`` I said I would '' , Pam said ."
`` They won't talk about who gave the information .
Not unless they have to .
"They don't , Mrs. Constable ."
Not unless they have '' --
She was interrupted .
Madden's dark face wore a meditative look .
Much better to break a cellar window '' .
`` Yeah .
And a pane of glass isn't hard to '' --
The telephone interrupted him .
I was hoping I'd hear from you today '' .
He hung up .
"`` Coroner '' , he said to Madden ."
Pauling looked at his notes .
`` Many minute hemorrhages in the lungs ; ;
No other cause of death apparent .
Trachea clear of mucus and foreign objects .
"Brain examined for thrombosis , clot or hemorrhage ."
He paused .
`` That's about it .
"Oh , the time of death ."
Pauling paused again .
"`` So there it is '' , he said ."
They discussed this possibility .
"Arthur Williams had to be located , they agreed ."
This was Madden's suggestion ; ;
the police chief shook his head over it .
Scholarship applicant ? ?
Pauling looked doubtful .
He inferred that Hohlbein and Garth were high-priced lawyers .
He had lunch with Pauling .
Garth brought one out .
"`` Fairly recent '' , he remarked ."
`` Oh no .
Her estate had grown considerably .
particularly the scholarship fund .
Garth hesitated .
"Most of them this past year , I'd say ."
"She'd have consulted us , you see ."
"The inspector nodded , doubting this ."
It would have been Hohlbein who handled her affairs .
Madden settled back to read the will .
"Tenure , too ."
Very nice for him .
"to the Pecks , ten thousand each ; ;"
)
"Too bad , Madden thought ."
Joan Sheldon had earned the larger bequest .
"Mr. Hohlbein was left twenty thousand , Garth ten ."
There were no other names Madden recognized .
`` Old people have their idiosyncrasies '' .
"There was an annual audit , Garth informed him ."
No discrepancies or shortages had ever been found .
Brian Thayer was a thoroughly honest and competent administrator .
His salary had reached the ten thousand mark .
His expenses ran another four or five thousand .
Garth's glance began to flicker to his watch .
Motive ? ?
Ten-thousand-dollar bequest .
Brian Thayer had a downtown address .
Thayer folded it up and offered a drink .
The inspector declined .
Thayer shook his head .
"`` It's all I think about , too ."
That and her death .
It's still unbelievable that it was murder .
I want the captain in charge .
Where is he '' ? ?
"`` Phil , for God's sake , go away ."
The undersecretary's in there .
It's all in your mind '' .
"`` Leigh , get a grip on yourself ."
It's not about you or Midge .
Griffith looked at him suspiciously through red-rimmed eyes .
`` Not about me ? ?
"You mean it , Phil ? ?"
"You wouldn't pull my leg , old man ? ?"
`` I'm not pulling your leg .
Will you call that captain '' ? ?
"`` No use , he won't come '' ."
He peered closely at Hoag in the gathering darkness .
`` What happened to your head '' ? ?
`` I was hit -- knocked out .
Now will you get him '' ? ?
`` He says I'm to take the message '' .
He stared at Hoag drunkenly .
`` Who'd hit you in the head '' ? ?
`` It doesn't matter .
"Griffith said , `` That's impossible ."
Mahzeer's the ambassador '' .
`` Nevertheless it's true '' .
`` Impossible '' .
`` I'll show you how wrong you are .
He nodded triumphantly .
`` So that proves it '' ! !
Hoag looked terrified .
`` Where are they '' ? ?
"`` Where'd you expect , the john ? ?"
Mahzeer's office '' .
`` Where is that '' ? ?
"`` Facing us , two flights up ."
"Look , old man , you can't go up ."
They won't even let you in the front door .
Hoag grabbed him by the shoulders .
"`` Listen to me , Leigh ."
He bit out the words .
`` And you know I can do it '' .
Griffith raised placating hands .
"`` Easy does it , Phil ."
I was just going .
I'm on my way '' .
At the top a uniformed officer blocked further progress .
"`` Yes , what is it '' ? ?"
He asked .
`` I want Captain Docherty '' .
They walked toward each other .
`` Well '' ? ?
Griffith looked half-crocked to the captain ; ;
it would be just like him .
`` Why not '' ? ?
Docherty went taut : was it possible ? ?
"Not possible , he thought ; ;"
"Still , this had to be checked out ."
He asked .
"`` Haven't the faintest , Captain '' ."
`` Would you mind sending him up here ? ?
I'd like to talk to him '' .
He would have to do something on his own .
But what ? ?
These were the early departures ; ;
in half an hour the reception would be over .
the scene looked like a Christmas card .
This would be Mahzeer's office .
The single shot would come ; ;
Hoag would carry its sound to his grave .
"Mahzeer , of course , would be desolate ."
Hoag turned .
Where across the street ? ?
Where was Muller waiting with the rifle ? ?
Most of them could be eliminated ; ;
Would the shot come from a roof ? ?
He ran his eye along the roof copings ; ;
almost at once a figure bulked up .
If only the latter were true .
He quickly closed it again .
there were six apartments .
Now what ? ?
The names on the mailboxes meant nothing to him .
He peered in the boxes themselves ; ;
Had Muller made the same deduction ? ?
Muller was attracted to the lore of mailboxes .
He opened the inner door ; ;
What was he to do now ? ?
He had thought no further than finding Muller .
He could not break in on an armed man .
Was there time ? ?
his face wore a look of outrage .
`` Where's the Lieut '' ? ?
The clerk wagged his head toward the captain's office .
"Leave me alone , Gun thought ."
But leave me alone .
Gun waited .
"`` No , sir '' ."
"`` Running in , running out ."
Can't have it .
Makes for confusion and congestion '' .
Roll was being called .
Gun cleared his throat .
"`` No , sir '' ."
Then Killpath smiled .
"`` Sergeant Vaughn , sir '' ."
"He smiled thinly , savoring his joke ."
He must have '' --
"Now that's not regulation , is it '' ? ?"
"`` No , sir '' ."
Killpath leaned forward ; ;
But stupidity was no consolation when it had rank .
"`` Oh , yes ."
So I have heard '' .
A car pulled into the driveway outside the window .
`` Well '' ? ?
Killpath licked his lips .
"`` Negligence , hell '' ! !"
`` Sir .
"`` Morning , Lieutenant Rinker '' ."
"`` Sorry , Orville ."
I thought you hadn't come in yet '' .
`` I've been here for some time '' .
`` The sergeant is just leaving '' .
He just didn't want to talk about it .
Not yet .
Then
Language was no problem anyway ; ;
`` I put her in lamps .
That way I don't lose so much '' .
He shrugged .
`` Where did you pick him up '' ? ?
She glanced at her companion fondly .
"`` Haven't I , George '' ? ?"
`` Can I tell you a secret ? ?
We're going to get married .
Do you approve '' ? ?
`` Of course not '' .
"`` Stop by any time , Casey '' ."
He stood up and touched the girl's arm .
"`` Come on , darling ."
Jack :
Look in the wastebasket .
It no longer mattered that Burton had outsmarted him .
And that gun was empty .
How can I find him ? ?
"`` Yeah '' , he said ."
`` Casey '' ? ?
`` Yeah '' .
`` Tony Calenda '' .
`` What picture '' ? ?
He demanded .
`` Who says so '' ? ?
`` One of my boys '' .
Casey believed that much .
`` So '' ? ?
"`` Look '' , he said ."
`` I was hired to take a picture .
I took it .
`` You tell him '' .
"`` But I meant what I said , Casey ."
"`` You do that '' , Casey said ."
He should have stayed here and watched Burton .
He didn't .
So he made a mistake .
So what ? ?
Only then did he decide he didn't want one .
`` Casey ? ?
You don't know me but I know you .
Some of them came from people who identified themselves .
`` We're out just a little too far .
Make a 90 degree straight for shore '' .
`` Now '' ? ?
He asked .
"`` Pretty quick '' , she replied ."
`` Will you drop the anchor '' ? ?
"Nobody , he suddenly realized , was saying anything ."
No one had screamed .
No one had prayed .
The pilot had been good .
a tension similar to the one now .
Yet tension existed .
Poet whistled softly as he looked at the gun .
`` Hydraulic '' ? ?
He asked .
Elaine nodded .
`` They are the best '' .
`` They are the most efficient '' .
`` Why do you need an arsenal '' ? ?
"Nick asked , apprehensively , staring at the weapon ."
Alfredo certainly must have enjoyed being alone .
But Graham hadn't stumbled on it .
`` Any luck '' ? ?
He asked .
`` Any news '' ? ?
`` Not a thing '' .
`` Cigarette '' ? ?
`` Kee-reist '' ! !
Nick's body became rigid .
Poet ! !
Poet a murderer ? ?
The sudden silence was too silent .
She had caught the implication of the oath .
`` Do you need a bandage '' ? ?
She asked steadily .
Poet rubbed his arm .
`` I'll get some ointment '' .
Elaine turned and started toward the companionway .
Nick sensed it .
So did Poet .
But Nick would not let go .
The air hose was free ! !
The discovery struck Nick like a blow .
Poet was not fighting Nick now .
Chief Bob Moore looked his same hick-self ; ;
a man mountain running to lard in his middle-age .
"You sure climbed fast , Jed ."
Rookie investigator last summer and now it's Inspector Jed .
Proves a college education pays off '' .
"`` Don't worry about my being tough , Moore ."
Who was the murdered woman Mrs. Buck '' ? ?
"`` Widow , nice sort of woman ."
Comfortably fixed .
Ran a fair-sized farm .
"`` Okay , what happened '' ? ?"
"Anyway , Julia asks me to ."
''
`` Julia '' ? ?
"`` Come on , Inspector , look alive ."
`` Julia asks me to come out at once .
I would have come sooner if I'd known .
Told them I can handle this '' .
Who's '' ? ?
`` I'll collar Tim before night '' .
`` Who's your witness '' ? ?
Probably the last of the original Island Indians .
And then rushed out of the house .
Then she heard Julia phone me .
Another fact : Tim's disappeared -- on the run .
`` Let's see it '' .
Powerful hands had killed her .
`` Find any prints '' ? ?
"I dropped the sheet , glanced at my watch ."
It was almost one and I hadn't had lunch .
`` Sure '' .
She was also stone deaf in her right ear .
She calmly repeated what Moore had told me .
I do the living room last .
`` Probably wages .
Miss Julia was a hard woman with a dollar .
`` Did you hear Tim return '' ? ?
`` No sir .
Nobody came until Chief Moore '' .
I drummed on the kitchen table with my pencil .
`` Mrs. Buck have any men friends '' ? ?
`` Her '' ? ?
`` I never see none .
But then I wasn't her social secretary '' .
`` Didn't have no family -- around here .
I walked into the living room .
`` I'll take you there .
"Okay , come on '' ."
Mrs. Williams was both sullen and frightened .
She hadn't seen him since .
I asked .
"Tim is a good man , hard working ."
`` Does your husband have a car '' ? ?
I asked .
`` Got us an old station wagon .
Need it for the job '' .
She shook her head .
I knew she was lying .
He'll get a fair trial .
`` Yes .
I'll tell him -- if I see him '' .
I tried not to act scared .
That Jaguar could really barrel along .
"Lighting my pipe , I took a walk ."
"He said , `` You bet ."
Bob Moore is plumb crazy about blue fishing '' .
I got into the front seat .
I waited a few minutes and she sat up .
`` Maybe .
didn't answer .
But the police have dropped the case .
`` Why not ? ?
The police have finished with it .
`` That's your headache .
"Once inside , keep your eyes open '' ! !"
`` For what '' ! !
Alec was growing more and more skeptical .
The hotel people will have scoured and vacuumed it .
`` I'm betting on that chance .
Interview the bellboy and chambermaid who waited on Beauclerk .
Study the topography of the suite .
Soak up local color .
Reenact everything Beauclerk did .
Alec smirked .
`` Cheerful way to spend an evening '' ! !
A sudden thought wiped the smirk from his face .
The chief's eyes gleamed .
He spoke softly .
`` That is exactly what I'm hoping for .
"After all , the murderer is still at large ."
"Daniel Forbes , her divorced husband , lived there ."
No one saw Stacy leave .
No other visitor inquired for her that evening .
Colt revolver in her brain .
Her door was locked and the key was missing .
So was the gun .
Forbes had motive and Stacy had opportunity .
"`` Certainly , sir '' ."
`` Do you recall the number '' ? ?
`` It was 1105 '' .
The clerk's smile congealed .
`` That suite is taken '' .
Opposite the number 1105 stood one word : Unoccupied .
The clerk's glance followed Alec's .
`` Larger and more comfortable .
At the same rate '' .
"Alec's face was dark , blunt , and sulky ."
He always looked impertinent and he could look dangerous .
He was looking dangerous now .
He raised his voice .
There was a sudden stillness in the lobby .
Even the bellboys on their bench were listening .
The clerk's eyes flickered .
`` Of course not '' ! !
`` No '' ! !
The clerk was almost hysterical .
`` I don't believe it '' .
`` There might be a story in it '' .
`` St-story '' ? ?
"`` I'm with the Syndicated Press , Feature Service ."
It was blackmail and the clerk knew it .
`` Front ! !
Show this gentleman to 1105 '' ! !
He could feel eyes on his back .
"A thick , crimson carpet muffled every footfall ."
It was a neat setup for murder .
The bellboy unlocked a white door numbered 1105 .
Hastily the boy switched on a ceiling light .
The room looked normal and even commonplace .
There was no hint of a violent struggle now .
The blue rug was suspiciously bright and new .
It had never been stained with blood .
Alec played the part of an innocent tourist .
`` N-no '' .
The boy dropped his eyes .
The boy raised his eyes .
"`` Listen , mister ."
The boy hesitated .
"Then , `` I'm not talking ."
Alec gave him a tip and let him go .
"Alone , Alec examined the doors ."
It was just quarter of nine .
"They used pink , tan , or cream powder ."
Alec glanced into the bathroom .
He crawled into bed and switched off the light .
In less than five minutes Alec was asleep .
He never knew just what woke him .
Yet suddenly he was wide-awake .
Alec heard a faint sound .
For the sound was inside the room .
The sound was coming nearer .
"Cautiously Alec tensed his muscles , ready to jump ."
The bedsprings betrayed him with a creak .
The shadow vanished .
He lashed out blindly with his right .
Something hard grazed his knuckles .
Rough cloth rasped his fist .
Something heavy shook the floor as it dropped .
"Alec waited a moment , on guard ."
Nothing happened .
Again he groped for the light switch .
On the bare floorboards a man lay face down .
"He had a short , heavy , powerful body ."
Alec promptly removed the gun .
He was familiar with this type .
But he was surprised to meet it here .
Diana Beauclerk had no connection with the underworld .
.
The man's eyelids fluttered .
He opened his eyes .
`` What are you doing here '' ? ?
Demanded Alec .
The man made no reply .
His eyes were dazed .
`` Did you kill Diana Beauclerk '' ? ?
The silence was getting on Alec's nerves .
`` Don't you speak English '' ? ?
The man opened his mouth wider .
A forefinger pointed toward his gullet .
Alec leaned forward to look .
He was sharpening his razor .
"Without a tremor , `` God forbid '' ! !"
What has this to do with the present ? ?
"Much , I assure you ."
That's why I beg you not to forget him .
His ghost is not laid .
You know the facts ; ;
they are set forth in your own newspapers .
The ' when ' you know ; ;
yesterday morning .
"Places , too , have their haunting qualities ."
Even people .
There's a different hall-mark on them .
We'll walk up there later .
It's perhaps a mile from here where we sit .
"A fascinating pursuit , I assure you ."
"That's your setting , and a sinister one ."
Please get that in your reports .
It accounts for so many things .
"Handley lived further on , at Pigeon Cove ."
"They were both painters , ( They were ? ?"
They are ? ?
What should one say ? ?
I knew Red and Handley well .
"As I said , they were both painters ."
"They married cousins , Anta and Freya Norberg ."
What's that ? ?
But you've got to know both .
What's below the water-line interests me also .
Like his glossy black hair .
"Too many outside manners , to my taste ."
"Red was small and fine-boned , like ivory-inlay ."
He too asked to see the same page .
They actually bristled .
Le rouge et le noir .
Violent men both .
The Beech Pasture had suddenly become valuable .
"It began with a preamble , of course ."
Paint ! !
I suppose Handley knew it .
By such touches the pattern takes shape .
You would call these the motives of crime .
"Oh yes , he'd talked about doing so ."
"Anta , his wife , never seemed to mind ."
That's what the man had said .
Was the man drunk or crazy or both ? ?
Why hadn't he noticed it before ? ?
"No , the man was not drunk"
"But , of course , he remembered now ."
Haney hadn't given it much thought at the time .
Phil was like that .
Haney managed a weak laugh .
"`` Guess I can't think of anyone , Pete ."
Thanks anyhow '' .
A faint crease appeared between the man's eyebrows .
I meant it .
And everybody has some kind of grudge .
I believe in returning favors .
I'll do anything for somebody I like .
"It won't cost you a cent , Phil ."
Go ahead and try me '' ! !
Phil rubbed his forehead wearily .
He was beginning to feel woolly .
The man closed his eyes and nodded .
`` Fine .
Give me your address .
It will take a little time .
"Maybe suicide , if it looks reasonable ."
Haney's eyebrows flew up .
`` Customer '' ? ?
Pete smiled modestly .
"`` It's my line of work '' , he said"
Phil shrugged and ignored him .
He went back to work Monday .
By Wednesday the landlord was still alive .
The landlord had died .
He had apparently been alone .
"But after all , why should they ? ?"
So you thought I didn't mean what I said .
"However , Haney knew it was not a dream ."
This favorite grievance was not the landlord .
He had already quite forgotten about him .
His real grievance was Lolly .
Pete ? ?
-- he hadn't seen him sit down .
"Pete frowned slightly , then became sad and moody ."
But there was no trouble .
`` But why pay her bills ? ?
Haney scowled .
`` Then she'd get half of everything I have .
Community property deal -- you know .
She can drop dead '' ! !
Pete nodded understandingly .
`` Oh yes .
Now I see .
I came out here to retire .
You should have told me about her before '' .
"`` No offense intended '' , he said gently ."
"After all , I didn't know you , Pete ."
It could have been an accident '' .
He shrugged casually .
His eyes burned feverishly .
"`` Yes , yes '' , he muttered impatiently ."
`` Of course it looked like an accident .
"Let me prove it , Phil ."
He waited eagerly .
"`` C'mon '' , he whispered ; ;"
"I went through and down , into pitch darkness ."
"He said , `` Jist stay still ."
Jist stay where you are '' .
"`` You first '' , I said ."
He drank and handed it back .
"`` Nice place '' , I told him ."
"I know where he is , right near here ."
His `` sure-sure '' was enthusiastic this time .
He put the bottle down .
"Charlie was waiting , leaning against a building front ."
"`` Perfect set-up '' , I told him ."
On the way I'll give you the scoop '' .
On the way I gave him the scoop .
And a blaring final chord from the jazz group .
But we could wait all right ; ;
there was no hurry .
We'd heard the record together once .
The second bottle passed a few times .
He had a capacity ; ;
It was a lead pipe cinch .
"Out cold , if not dead ; ;"
I gauged that blow to be borderline .
To kayo him and maybe or maybe not kill .
Dig '' ? ?
"I dug him , I saw his point ; ;"
it made sense .
"Charlie said , `` Good boy ."
"That did it , if mine didn't ."
And we'll never know which .
I nodded to Charlie .
It's a more natural position '' .
We did that .
`` How do you feel '' ? ?
Charlie asked me .
"`` Cool '' , I told him ."
`` What do you feel '' ? ?
`` Nothing .
Well maybe I'm exaggerating .
"Now , first question : the bottles ."
"`` Take them '' , I said ."
`` Right .
Now '' -- He looked around .
`` I've been careful about fingerprints .
How about you '' ? ?
`` Same .
Same goes for the rough cement of the ledge .
`` We can't take a chance on that .
Let's do that '' .
"Which , if it matters , was one A.M. ."
It had gone like clockwork .
How safe is too safe ? ?
But we were really going to do it .
We shook hands on it .
I drew diagrams and floor plans ; ;
"`` One thing we haven't discussed , expense money ."
He sighed .
"`` All right , I'll come clean ."
A couple of hundred .
"`` Solid '' , I said ."
"I took a deep breath , and the plunge ."
"`` In that case , let's not draw ."
I'll go to bat first .
But your friend Manny can go any time '' .
He grinned and clapped me on the shoulder .
"`` I was hoping you'd say that , Willy ."
But I wouldn't have suggested it .
Self's integrity was and is and ever had been .
Mike remained in trance ; ;
`` Thou art God '' .
He had been weary ; ;
`` Hi '' ! !
`` Oh .
"Hello , Mike ."
"My , you look chipper '' ."
`` I feel fine ! !
Where is everybody '' ? ?
`` Asleep .
`` Oh '' .
Mike felt disappointed that Mahmoud had left ; ;
he wanted to explain his new grokking .
Are you hungry '' ? ?
"`` Sure , I'm hungry '' ! !"
"They went downstairs , loaded a tray lavishly ."
`` Let's take it outside .
It's plenty warm '' .
"`` A fine idea '' , Mike agreed ."
`` Warm enough to swim -- real Indian summer .
I'll switch on the floods '' .
"`` Don't bother '' , Mike answered ."
`` I'll carry the tray '' .
He could see in almost total darkness .
his foster parents had taught him to see .
"`` Okay , take the tray ."
I'll switch on the underwater lights .
That'll be plenty to eat by '' .
`` Fine '' .
Mike liked having light up through the ripples ; ;
"it was a goodness , beauty ."
"`` Mike , there's Mars ."
"It is Mars , isn't it ? ?"
Or Antares '' ? ?
`` It is Mars '' .
`` Mike ? ?
What are they doing on Mars '' ? ?
He hesitated ; ;
plants are being taught to grow '' .
`` ' Taught to grow ' '' ? ?
He hesitated .
`` Larry teaches plants to grow .
I have helped him .
"But my people -- Martians , I mean ; ;"
He thought .
"Yes , I heard it in the news '' ."
Mike had not heard it ; ;
he had not known it until asked .
`` They should not be sad .
the Old Ones have cherished him '' .
`` You knew him '' ? ?
`` Yes .
"He had his own face , dark and beautiful ."
But he was homesick '' .
"`` Oh , dear ! !"
Mike do you ever get homesick ? ?
For Mars '' ? ?
`` I was lonely always '' .
`` But now I am not lonely .
I grok I shall never be lonely again '' .
Presently his water brother said breathlessly .
"`` Oh , my ! !"
That was almost worse than the first time '' .
`` Yes .
Yes indeed .
Kiss me again '' .
`` I know .
It is for growing closer .
Now we grow closer '' .
turn just a little .
I'll help '' .
Her answer was not in words .
Oh ! !
Thou art God '' ! !
`` We grok God '' .
25 .
time was not yet .
the purpose was less immediate .
A funeral parlor chain was indicted for price-cutting .
Digby was not pleased with his promotion .
Eternity is no time for recriminations .
Afterwards you did well enough .
Same as with the Popes .
Some of them were warts until they got promoted .
"Digby calmed down , but made one request ."
Foster shook his halo .
`` You can't touch him .
You shouldn't have tried to .
"I'm helping you now , am I not ? ?"
"The Boss wants performance , not gripes ."
"Get Happy , junior '' ! !"
Digby heaved a deep ethereal sigh .
"`` Okay , I'm Happy ."
Where do I start '' ? ?
His household had gone through an upset .
The expense and time involved are astronomical .
that is all I can tell you about them .
`` How did you know '' ? ?
He said sharply .
"`` Forgive me , Sandalphon '' , said Hal ."
`` But it was inevitable ! !
I believe it was on page 573 '' ! !
How could they not ? ?
Thought Hal .
"Besides , they were not the only impressions ."
"He was a good impresser , that Pornsen ."
Was ? ?
Is ! !
He was my gapt in the creche .
He is now my block gapt .
"Swiftly , came the revulsion , the protest ."
"`` No '' , said Macneff ."
And it leaves very soon '' .
`` You need a linguist '' ? ?
Said Hal .
Unfortunately ''
"Hal waited : Macneff paced some more , frowning ."
Therefore ''
"`` A thousand pardons '' , said Hal ."
`` But I have just thought of one thing .
I am married '' .
"`` No problem at all '' , said Macneff ."
`` There will be no women aboard the Gabriel .
"Naturally , he couched the provision in obscure language ."
"`` I volunteer '' , said Hal ."
"`` Tell me more , Sandalphon '' ."
Siberia spoke Icelandic .
Hal felt sorry for Mary ; ;
their mutual torture would be over .
Perhaps .
Hal doubted if this happy event would occur .
Mary was as frozen below the navel as he .
The gapt .
Pornsen .
`` Hal Yarrow '' ! !
Said the whining voice .
But I might have known ! !
We seem to be bound by love ; ;
Sigmen himself must have foreseen it .
"Love to you , my ward '' ."
`` How wonderful to see your cherished self .
5
The description of the Siddo syntax was very restricted .
This discovery caused Hal anxiety .
"Moreover , even getting this across would be difficult ."
Another obstacle was the grammatical construction of Siddo .
Consider the tense system .
The system of indicating gender varied according to tense .
)
There was nothing he could do but wait .
The dice were cast .
At last Gabriel spoke .
"`` We misjudged you '' , he said slowly ."
"Hesperus , you may speak '' ."
"`` Nevertheless , you were its agent ."
"His heart , he discovered , was pounding ."
"Between individuals , this process is called bargaining ."
Recovering the property was much less important '' .
"`` Strange '' , Gabriel said ."
`` And apparently impossible .
Another pause ; ;
but this one was not nearly as long .
`` Then it is a matter of pleasure ; ;
of curiosity ; ;
of a more alive time .
"Yes , those could be commodities under this concept ."
This explained a great deal .
To this we of course agree '' .
Nothing less would serve .
Yet there was some precedent for it .
Suppose that this one were to work ? ?
If mankind could be convinced of that
It was worth trying .
"In fact , it had to be tried ."
But he was too late .
He had lost his audience .
`` Hesperus ! !
What's going on here ? ?
What's happened '' ? ?
`` Your brothers have been found .
They are on their way here '' .
`` Where ? ?
I don't see them .
The instruments don't show them '' .
"`` You can't see them yet , Jack ."
They'll be in range in a short while '' .
Nothing .
and it was getting bigger rapidly .
"It was a startling , almost numenous sight ; ;"
"Fuming , helpless , he watched them pass him ."
But where was it going ? ?
Stern chase 10
Almost surely he did ; ;
`` Hesperus '' ? ?
`` Receiving '' .
But I can't take you to Earth yet .
Therefore of course I will help '' .
"Always before , it had taken five minutes to --"
Of course .
Hesperus was in there .
He rubbed his eyes sleepily with one huge paw .
He didn't say what would cure him ; ;
`` Ekstrohm '' ? ?
Ryan insisted .
`` Okay '' .
The facsiport rolled open on the landscape .
Ryan asked .
Ekstrohm asked .
"`` No helmets '' , the captain answered ."
"`` We can breathe out there , all right ."
It just won't be easy .
Nitrogen and oxygen are about it '' .
`` Animals .
Ringing the ship .
"Think they're intelligent , maybe hostile '' ? ?"
`` I get no readings from them at all .
"Sonic , electronic , galvanic -- all blank ."
"According to these needles , they're stone dead '' ."
"`` You hold down the fort , Nogol ."
Take it easy '' .
"`` Easy '' , Nogol confirmed ."
`` But I'm ambidextrous '' .
Ryan told him what he could do then .
Ekstrohm nudged it with a boot .
"`` Uh-huh '' , Ryan admitted ."
`` One of the best matches I've ever found .
"Well , it has to happen ."
Statistical average and all .
The surveyor looked sidewise at the captain .
The big man seldom gave out with such thoughts .
Ekstrohm cleared his throat .
`` What shall we do with this one ? ?
Dissect it '' ? ?
"`` I don't know , Stormy ."
"No hands , for one thing ."
"Of course , that's not definite proof '' ."
"`` No , it isn't '' , Ekstrohm said ."
What killed them '' ? ?
`` Radiation '' ? ?
Ekstrohm suggested .
`` I don't know about that .
Maybe it would work the other way .
Or maybe it's sheer xenophobia .
"`` Maybe '' , the captain admitted ."
But there's one possibility I particularly don't like '' .
`` And that is '' ? ?
I just hope it doesn't work on Earthmen too .
These critters went real sudden '' .
The Earthmen made camp outside the spaceship .
Ekstrohm was not asleep .
Now there could be an end to pretending .
Ekstrohm stood up .
There was no longer any need to hide .
But what was there to do ? ?
What had changed for him ? ?
It was small comfort for insomnia .
Ekstrohm never slept .
but he never slept .
Never at all .
"Naturally , he couldn't let his shipmates know this ."
He had to hide it .
The buddies invariably took advantage of him .
Ekstrohm had to hide his secret .
But the secret itself was just as hard .
"Behind him , his mates stirred without waking ."
The angry burnt-red face of Ryan greeted him .
What did you do with them '' ? ?
`` Do with what '' ? ?
`` The dead beasties .
All the dead animals laying around the ship '' .
"`` What are you talking about , Ryan ? ?"
`` I don't know .
All I know is that they are gone '' .
`` Gone '' ? ?
Ekstrohm shouldered his way outside and scanned the veldt .
There was no ring of animal corpses .
Nothing .
Nothing but wispy grass whipping in the keen breeze .
"`` I'll be damned '' , Ekstrohm said ."
"`` You are right now , buddy ."
ExPe doesn't like anybody mucking up primary evidence '' .
Ekstrohm demanded .
`` Why pick me for your patsy ? ?
Now comes this ! !
What would I want with them '' ? ?
The tapes show that .
It was not a new experience to Ekstrohm .
No .
Suspicion wasn't new to him at all .
"Look for them , will you ? ?"
"Take my word , can't you '' ? ?"
Ryan shook his head .
`` I don't think I can .
There's still such a thing as mental illness .
You may not be responsible '' .
Ekstrohm scowled .
"`` Don't try anything violent , Stormy ."
`` I wasn't planning on jumping you .
She lived and was given a name .
Helva .
She would be among the elite of her kind .
She had tuned her sight to the proper degree .
Her hum became a gurgle of surprise .
I enjoyed my lessons '' .
Any other reaction would have been reported instantly .
`` Thank you .
Would you like to see my work '' ? ?
"Helva asked , politely ."
`` Work '' ? ?
Asked the lady .
"The lady's eyes , unmagnified , bugged out ."
"If she could have blushed , she would have ."
`` You people don't have adjustable vision '' .
`` I had that in mind '' .
`` Which you are programed to compute '' ? ?
`` Of course '' .
`` Singing '' as applicable to herself required research .
"Shell people did not , strictly speaking , breathe ."
"When she awoke , she was the ship ."
The ship always chose its own partner .
"`` Hello , anyone at home '' ? ?"
Tanner wisecracked .
`` Are you my partner '' ? ?
`` No one has come .
It would have killed you in the cabin .
Do you have anything for me '' ? ?
Mercer never noticed the needle touch his arm .
The many-bodied girl lay near him .
Mercer spoke to her .
`` Isn't it wonderful ? ?
"You're beautiful , beautiful , beautiful ."
I'm so happy to be here '' .
She radiated warmth and good fellowship .
Mercer thought that she looked very distinguished and charming .
He struggled out of his clothes .
The two women babbled and crooned at him .
With most of his mind he was happy .
A painful stab hit him in the abdomen .
The drug went after the pain and swallowed it .
He forced himself to be deliberate .
Maybe I will grow another head .
That would make B'dikkat happy '' ! !
"Said she , `` I'm strong , too ."
I can talk .
"Remember , man , remember ."
People never live forever .
I do so believe in death '' ! !
Mercer smiled at her through his happiness .
`` Of course you can .
But isn't this nice ''
B'dikkat was sterilizing his knives .
Mercer wondered how long the super-condamine had lasted him .
Time had no meaning .
The dromozoa fed him in their mysterious way ; ;
The pains themselves had not changed ; ;
he had .
He remembered them well from his happy period .
Mercer squeezed the man's shoulder .
That's out of a play .
Did you ever see a play '' ? ?
`` You mean a game with cards '' ? ?
"`` Soon '' , said the half-man ."
That's why I think of plays .
We all know what is going to happen .
We all know when it is going to happen .
`` What's a ' scene ' '' ? ?
Asked Mercer .
The half-man laughed with something close to real humor .
"`` No , no , no ."
You've got the lovelies on the brain .
A scene is just a part of a play .
The pain seems short and the pleasure seems long .
Take it out of me '' ! !
It might have been several days .
It might have been several months .
once again they clustered like children .
Mercer got the blissful needle .
Then there had been another head beside his own .
He forgot the order .
He did not count time .
She had lost the extra torsos .
"Good luck , fellow '' ."
Mercer turned away .
What persuaded the cow-man to remain on Shayol ? ?
What kept him happy without super-condamine ? ?
His own fate he accepted .
He staggered back to the group .
"4 ,"
The land of Shayol did not change .
`` People never live forever '' .
There was no dream of escape for these people .
His handwriting was on a rock .
Nor did they care .
Dan Morgan told himself he would forget Ann Turner .
He was well rid of her .
But all of this was rationalization .
He had plenty of work to do .
The boy licked his dry lips .
Morgan jerked his head toward the front door .
"`` In the kitchen '' , he said ."
`` Get up .
There's water in the house '' .
She didn't move or say anything .
"They looked a good deal alike , Morgan thought ."
The girl dropped off to sleep .
He asked .
"`` I'm Billy Jones '' , the boy answered ."
`` That's my wife Sharon .
`` What are you doing here '' ? ?
`` Are we in Wyoming '' ? ?
Morgan nodded .
`` About five miles north of the line '' .
Jones sighed as if relieved .
Morgan demanded .
Why didn't you go there '' ? ?
`` Then we're lucky we got here .
"Could you give us a job , Mr. ''"
`` Morgan .
Dan Morgan '' .
He dismissed the possibility at once .
The girl's thin face haunted him .
It wasn't the face of a killer .
He wasn't so sure about the boy .
They were running from something .
"Sharon , she's cooked in a restaurant ."
"We'll work hard , Mr. Morgan '' ."
"`` I'll see '' , Morgan said ."
Your wife's in terrible shape '' .
"`` I know '' , Jones said dejectedly ."
`` Who are you ? ?
How did we get here '' ? ?
`` I'm Dan Morgan .
This is the Rafter Aj .
`` Oh '' .
`` Of course '' .
"`` I'm sorry , Mr. Morgan ."
"`` And hungry '' , he said ."
`` Start in .
`` Not much of a meal '' ? ?
The girl cried .
Morgan laughed .
`` Which are you '' ? ?
"`` We're not drunkards '' , she said ."
`` That's all I'm sure of '' .
"Your feet are in bad shape , Mrs. Jones ."
"`` We'll see '' , Morgan said ."
The girl asked .
`` My dress needs some work on it '' .
He said : `` I'm going to bed '' .
He nodded at the door in front of him .
`` That's my spare bedroom .
"`` You're awfully kind '' , the girl said ."
`` We'll pay you back if you'll let us .
Some way '' .
"`` It's all right '' , he said ."
`` I get up early .
You'd better sleep '' .
We haven't slept together since we started .
"`` We got fired '' , Jones said ."
`` We had to do something '' .
Gavin paused wearily .
`` You can't stay here with me .
`` You can't make me go '' .
`` Do you remember Big Charlie '' ? ?
He whispered .
`` He stuck with me all these years .
I believed him .
"My men , they all left me ."
Just cleared out .
"I didn't understand why , Clay ."
They just all cleared out .
I treated them fair ''
`` Yes '' .
`` You don't hate me any more '' ? ?
`` Come here '' .
I tried .
I saw you driftin away -- but I tried .
Now there's nothin left of me .
Oh ! !
"God in Heaven , I can't refuse you now ."
That would mock me too much ! !
"`` I'll go , Clay '' ."
Clayton freed himself from the embrace and stepped back .
The eyes followed him fearfully .
`` The horses .
There isn't much time .
I'll saddle the horses and bring them round .
You get ready ''
The mare had backed away .
`` She doesn't want you now .
"Gavin stood on the porch , a thin figure ."
`` To a ranch in the valley .
There's someone there I have to see .
We may take her with us -- to California .
"I don't know yet , it's crazy ; ;"
I have to think about it .
But California is where we're goin '' .
`` California '' .
Gavin began to nod .
`` That's a new land .
A man could make a mark there .
"`` Yes , like a father and son '' ."
`` I made you so you could stand up .
I made you a man '' .
"`` Yes , Gavin , you did '' ."
"`` Help me up , Clay ."
`` They'll trample it down .
I loved my garden '' .
`` It will grow again -- in California '' .
Lived alone by the river .
"It was nice then , so peaceful and quiet ."
There was no one but me .
I don't want to leave it '' .
Thirty-five
they rode at a measured pace through the valley .
Gavin sighed bitterly .
Then at last the darkness began to dissolve .
But the liquor had flushed their courage .
`` He's leavin .
"That's what you wanted , isn't it ? ?"
You can't '' --
"`` Keep out of this '' , Purvis snarled ."
"`` He's not your brother , he's Gavin's son ."
Joe Purvis was thinking back many years .
He wouldn't even dance with her at Gavin's party .
He treats her like she was dirt .
He turned to Lester .
He meant to help Gavin all the time .
"He made a fool of you , Lester '' ."
Lester's hand fluttered to Cabot's shoulder .
The boy jerked away .
Purvis and Silas Pettigrew were the last to leave .
Thirty-six
They neither gained nor fell back .
He rode low on the mare's neck .
Gavin's face was bloodless with excitement .
He did not look back ; ;
Now they were riding to kill him .
"California is too far , he thought ."
He would never reach California .
The sentry was not dead .
A bayonet hung in a belt scabbard .
Mike stripped these from him and donned them .
They dragged him inside the building .
"Fiske joined them , unsteady on his feet ."
"Julia , seeing the bandage , rushed to him ."
`` You are hurt '' ! !
She breathed .
`` You are very brave '' .
Mike silenced them .
`` We'll talk later .
"`` We'll grab horses '' , Dean said ."
He had none here .
The guerrilla bivouac remained silent .
Someone evidently was on duty there .
No doubt there would be men guarding the horses .
He handed the guard's rifle to Fiske .
`` We'll stampede the rest .
You stay with the ladies .
Susan halted Dean and kissed him .
Mike turned away .
He felt unutterably weary .
"He kissed her also , and with deep tenderness ."
She too began to weep .
He released her and joined Mike .
"`` All right '' , he said ."
"Mike only said , `` Later '' ."
"`` Be careful , McLish '' ! !"
Susan said fiercely .
`` The way you were careful '' ? ?
He snorted .
He kept going .
He wanted no more sentimental scenes with her .
He might say or do something foolish .
Something all of them would regret .
One wing stood open .
A voice spoke near-at-hand .
`` Who's that '' ? ?
"Just me '' , Mike said ."
"`` Is that you , Bill '' ? ?"
He located his man .
Mike struck with the muzzle of the pistol .
The guard instinctively parried the blow with his rifle .
The bullet went wide .
Mike swung the pistol in a savage backlash .
The startled horses began rearing on their tethers .
Dean came rushing up .
`` Are you hit '' ? ?
He demanded .
Mike said .
You'll have to try it alone '' .
`` Up you go '' ! !
He said .
`` Ride '' ! !
`` Why not you '' ? ?
He protested .
`` Dammit '' ! !
Mike said frantically .
`` You're lighter than me .
It's our only chance now .
Try to find these Feds .
You're the one that's taking the big chance '' .
Watch out for Apaches when it comes daylight .
Take the pistol .
You might need it .
Then he was on his way at a gallop .
He lifted a screeching war whoop .
That touched off a total stampede .
These poured through the gate and joined the flight .
`` Apaches '' ! !
Mike yelled .
`` They're stealin' the stock '' ! !
He crouched there .
His shout had been taken up and repeated .
Durkin and Calhoun came running from the post .
They had pistols in their hands .
They followed the others toward the east gate .
The area was deserted .
Mike crawled to the door and peered in .
The orderly room seemed to be deserted .
"A lantern hung from a peg , giving light ."
Shouldering the load he peered from the door .
He set his bundle down .
He picked up the powder canister and ran out .
Powder flame gushed beneath the wagon .
They realized the truth .
Bullets began to snap past him .
Guerrillas were racing toward him .
Susan bounced to her feet and slammed the door .
Some tore entirely through the whipsawed post oak .
He peered from a loophole .
He dropped a man with the first bullet .
That halted the rush .
The guerrillas scattered for cover .
The wagons were burning fiercely .
The mudwagon had caught fire also .
The blaze was spreading to the frame buildings .
The guerrillas realized they faced a new problem .
`` Gawdamighty '' ! !
One screeched .
`` There goes our grub an' ammunition '' ! !
`` Get a bucket line going '' ! !
Calhoun shouted .
`` Hurry ! !
Hurry '' ! !
But what few containers they found were inadequate .
Both buildings were in flames .
The heat drove the guerrillas back .
The roof of the command post began to buckle .
`` Drag the wagons to the spring '' ! !
Lew Durkin yelled .
`` Run 'em right into the spring ! !
Hustle '' ! !
A sizable supply of powder had been touched off .
`` No .
Here comes Jason .
Keep this to yourself '' .
"Reverend Jason , looking worried , hurried toward us ."
"`` Anything wrong , cap'n ? ?"
The men seem to think so '' .
"They'll probably attack at dawn '' , Montero said ."
Fort up ! !
They all flew into action .
The Aricaras treated us like friends .
Oso gave me an unruffled look .
He shook his head .
`` Mr. Manuel did that in the war .
He did that with all the Nations .
I saw that letter .
"`` But that was war '' , I said ."
`` There's no war on now '' .
"`` You're wrong , Matt ."
`` That's why this company's important .
That bastard Chambers ! !
`` Let the savages kill each other .
What do we care '' ? ?
Reverend Jason was understandably bitter .
`` It was a terrible thing to do .
Those little children .
''
28 .
Attack
"Buckets were filled , the herd fed and watered ."
The worst part had been the waiting ; ;
I didn't catch a wink .
It was a relief when they finally came .
"`` Hold your fire '' , Montero was shouting ."
`` Wait until my shot .
I'll shoot the first man who doesn't '' .
I could see them in my sights .
They were about a mile off ; ;
under me the ground quivered slightly .
Gradually they emerged as men .
Gray Eyes was in the lead .
jagged red and black medicine symbols covered his chest .
He was naked except for a clout .
I found his chest in my sights .
It had a red circle .
The circle came nearer and nearer .
Montero's rifle cracked .
At first I thought he had missed .
Gray Eyes remained erect .
The feathered lance was still above his head .
I squeezed the trigger .
He jerked once in the grass and lay still .
`` If you're goin' to kill 'em -- ! !
Kill 'em '' ! !
Oso growled .
`` Lead up ! !
Lead up ! !
They'll be back '' ! !
Montero was shouting .
A rifle cracked ; ;
the square head fell over .
There was a ragged volley .
He was dead before he hit the ground .
Montero shouted furiously .
`` Wait for the charge ! !
"The charge , I tell you '' ! !"
They grew louder as the Indians charged again .
"`` Gray Eyes is back , , Montero said ."
I could see the blood running down his chest .
I forgot to aim .
there was no doubt he was dying .
Again we waited for Montero .
The bullet flung Gray Eyes from his horse .
But a few reached our wall .
Men screamed .
"Reverend Jason got one , the Canadians the others ."
The ponies were almost uncontrollable .
This time more of them hurdled the barrier .
It sounded like a man kicking a melon .
"I could smell woodsmoke , grease , and oil ."
The Aricaras made one last desperate charge .
None of them reached our walls again .
The few survivors grudgingly turned away .
It wouldn't matter to a fool like you .
It would to me '' .
"`` All right '' , Wilson said quickly ."
`` The fire's too big .
And I appreciate the advice '' .
He was losing patience again .
She had helped him change his mind .
"`` I'm not advising you '' , she said ."
`` I'm telling you .
That fire's too big .
Let it burn down .
He was taken aback .
It took him a long time to compose himself .
"`` There's some mistake '' , he said finally ."
`` You're right about the fire .
But you're wrong about the rest of it .
I'm not leaving in the morning .
Why should I ? ?
I own the place '' .
It didn't seem to tell her anything .
She studied it for a long time .
`` You own this place '' ? ?
`` You bought it '' ? ?
`` Jake Carwood .
Maybe you know him '' .
The girl laughed .
`` I know him .
I ought to .
Wilson didn't say anything .
"`` No '' , Wilson said ."
`` But it's understandable .
And it doesn't make any difference .
He sold me a clear title .
"I have it with me , right here ."
If you want to see '' --
"`` Never mind '' , she said sternly ."
I meant what I said about that fire .
Be sure it's out when you leave .
That's all .
`` It doesn't hurt .
"It might hurt you , though ."
Somebody might mistake you for a woman '' .
She was quick .
He wiped the blood from his cheek .
`` I ought to '' -- he said .
If you were a man '' --
"`` She isn't , mister '' ."
`` I am .
If you've got any ideas '' .
She seemed irritated .
The scar looked pure white in the half-darkness ; ;
"his eyes were black and deep-set , and expressionless ."
`` I can take care of this .
It's no job for you '' .
He took it without flinching .
"`` I said go home , Joseph ."
You've got no business up here '' .
The half-breed didn't answer this time .
It made Wilson wonder .
He watched the half-breed as he turned silently .
Wilson brushed the dust from his coat .
`` Who was that '' ? ?
He asked .
`` Your personal guard ? ?
You're pretty hard on him '' .
`` He's a friend .
His name's Joseph Sanchez .
"`` Not now '' , Wilson said ."
`` I guess I'll find out soon enough .
You've got blood on your cheek .
Not yours .
Mine .
`` I've had enough of that .
I've had enough of you .
You took me by surprise .
He had forgotten that she was so pretty .
And one had been too many .
And determined not to show it .
"`` Go to sleep '' , he said ."
`` Both of you .
"Not tonight , at any rate ."
He had a feeling that the girl meant trouble .
Not all of it .
But they were starting a new life .
The land wasn't all Wilson had expected of it .
"good grass , good water ."
And there was a house ; ;
"livable perhaps , but badly in need of repairs ."
It hadn't started out that way .

Kathy was already in the wagon .
He had an uneasy feeling about it .
Judith Pierce .
But there was water .
all dusty and sunbaked .
The place was quiet .
I was nearly thirty at the time .
Drifting here and there .
"Squatting , as if waiting ."
The pulsing glow of a cigarette .
The clerk paid them no attention .
His job simply consisted in registering new men .
When the phone rang he answered it .
Baldness was attacking his pate .
His hat ( the cause of his baldness ? ?
Everything about the clerk was trivial .
With distaste I saw him assume a pompous air .
What limited knowledge he possessed he forced upon me .
I withdrew my hand .
This sort of petty vigilance annoyed me .
I felt certain it was self-appointed .
I had signed it off on the forms .
"I did not despair , however ; ;"
far from it ! !
It resembled nothing I'd ever seen before .
Meanwhile spring had passed well into summer .
Cigarette butts littered the floor .
I stopped by the counter .
The director's office .
I rapped my knuckles on the counter .
The director came to the door .
"He wore perforated , white-topped shoes ; ;"
He did not look at them now .
Why had I registered ? ?
These questions did not surprise me ; ;
`` Tie him up '' .
`` Hell with it '' .
Rankin sneered at him .
He dumped me in solitary twice '' .
Fred Rankin looked at him .
`` Come on .
Let's move '' .
There was no chance .
There was no moon .
They had chosen this night purposely .
They looked up in surprise as Powers came in .
`` I've got to have help '' .
They stared at him .
The sergeant in charge climbed to his feet .
`` What's wrong with him '' ? ?
`` He's having some kind of a fit '' .
The sergeant turned to the door .
`` One sound and you're dead '' .
The sergeant froze .
Powers had not followed .
Powers was covering the remaining guard .
Powers knocked his arm aside .
They were free .
Even Barton could not quite believe it .
It had gone without a hitch .
Five minutes later they reached the horses .
No one hurried .
Five miles .
Foster had brought extra clothing also .
"A good man , Emmett ."
`` I won't even try to thank you '' .
The ex-prison guard was embarrassed .
I did it for the valley .
You're the only man the Night Riders will follow .
`` Good luck '' .
The murderer lifted his head .
`` You aren't one of us .
There's nothing for you here '' .
`` I got no place to go '' .
Barton hesitated .
But ten years in prison had taught him realities .
He had done time for the theft .
Both hated Donald Kruger .
The old Haskell mine '' .
Mitch Barton knew the place .
Barton nodded .
`` How do the valley people feel '' ? ?
`` As mad as ever .
I'm an outsider .
`` My boy .
Did you find him '' ? ?
`` He's in Morgan's Ferry '' .
Barton half-straightened in surprise .
`` What's he doing there '' ? ?
Again Dill hesitated .
`` Dealing faro '' .
`` Dealing faro ? ?
How come '' ? ?
Barton cursed under his breath .
`` Everyone .
Your cousin Finley saw to that .
"He's quite a rat , you know ."
He sold out to Kruger's men .
He's informed them of everything you've ever written him .
He wants your ranch '' .
Barton stood up .
"He said tensely , `` All right ."
Let's go get the boy '' .
Dill had come up also .
`` I was afraid of this .
I almost didn't tell you '' .
`` If you hadn't I'd have killed you '' .
Dill's voice tightened .
`` But you can't ride into the Ferry .
That's what they'll expect you to do .
They'll be there waiting for you .
I understand how you feel about the child .
''
`` The hell you do '' .
`` I never saw him .
`` I can't leave him there .
I've got to get the boy .
Let's ride '' .
Chapter two
The building was dwarfed by the scene outside .
A million dollars' of gold a month .
A million tons of rock and soil and brush .
The monitors ran twenty-four hours each day .
Fat showed in loose rolls beneath the shirt .
He lived and breathed for the mining company .
Hague had never accustomed himself to Kodyke .
He knew nothing about the man's history .
Kodyke was to head the dread company police .
He ran the change rooms .
He threw out the hi-graders .
Hague squeezed down his uneasy dislike .
`` This is Mitchell Barton .
He broke out of Folsom last night .
Apparently he bribed one of the guards .
`` Dangerous '' ? ?
"`` Dangerous , yes ."
You know how the ranchers in the valley are .
They blame us for all their troubles .
We don't want Barton's Night Riders loose again '' .
"As she drove , she thought about her plan ."
It was really quite simple .
"Perhaps it was insane , Pamela thought ."
Perhaps it was all a vividly conceived dream .
No wonder Melissa responded so completely to its beckoning .
Pamela felt calm and peaceful as she walked along .
Success depended upon maintaining her equanimity ; ;
The forest took on an impersonal aspect .
Pamela shook her head .
She must not think about time .
That was another one of those traps .
they would not dare to face his scoffing .
Pamela was glad Jim was nowhere near .
His presence would have interfered with her duty .
"Nevertheless , she continued to move upward ."
She looked around .
She was bewildered .
She was standing in a thick grove .
The thought made Pamela shudder .
A terrible chill swept through the grove .
But she did not know which way to go .
Does the mountain listen ? ?
Pamela groped blindly .
She had to escape .
Every movement she made seemed unnecessarily noisy .
Twigs cracked loudly under her feet ; ;
bushes swished and scratched at her slacks ; ;
"Miraculously , she found exactly the right statement ."
But '' --
She yanked away from him furiously .
`` You shut up ! !
Shu-tt up-pp ! !
Do you hear me ? ?
You're going to listen '' ! !
Lord nodded agreeably .
He said he wanted very much to listen .
So would she mind speaking a little louder ? ?
"`` I think you stink , Tom Lord ! !"
Said Joyce .
`` Uh-huh .
He opened the door and got out .
`` Well ? ?
Wasn't you goin' to say somethin' '' ? ?
"`` Aah , go on '' , she said ."
`` Just go the hell on '' .
"And he really feels that way , she thought ."
"That's really all he's got , all he is ."
If I could make myself feel the same way
"She studied him hopefully , yearningly ; ;"
He wasn't a big man ; ;
rather on the medium side .
Neither was he very powerful of build .
"Just nothing , she told herself ."
"teetering , half-mincing walk ."
She snapped .
`` How -- with what ? ?
There's nothing out here but rattlesnakes '' .
"`` Now , ain't it the truth '' ? ?"
Lord laughed with secret amusement .
`` Tom ! !
For God's sake '' ! !
`` Looky '' .
"He pointed , cutting her off ."
`` See that wildcat '' ? ?
"`` I '' -- She broke off , frowning ."
Getting the boss rattlesnake to help you '' ? ?
"She looked at him , lips compressed ."
"that is , to show no curiosity whatsoever ."
Lord whistled tunelessly as he fought the steering wheel .
He had a legitimate reason for wearing it .
`` So what's this all about '' ? ?
"He demanded , when Lord confronted him ."
It was the wrong thing to say .
"So , `` How about it '' ? ?"
He said .
"`` We aim t' be see-lective , y'know ? ?"
McBride reddened .
"`` Look , Lord '' , he said hoarsely ."
"But you're all wrong , man ! !"
I'm no lawyer .
"I just do what I'm told , and '' --"
`` uh-huh .
"McBride couldn't do either , of course ."
"Not immediately , as the deputy demanded ."
To do so would make his job well-nigh impossible .
Oil-field workers were a rough-tough lot .
`` huh-uh .
A rabbit punch redoubled him .
But he couldn't keep up with them .
No more could he defend himself against them .
I meant him no harm .
I've given willful hurt to no man .
He couldn't see ; ;
he was long past the point of coherent thinking .
And nothing would be done about it .
Nothing unless
Donna ! !
Donna was like he was .
And Donna would --
It especially bothered the older hands .
Supper would be ready within the hour .
"He'd come alone , without his wife and child ."
"`` Pat , get out of that creek ! !"
"You too , Sean ! !"
Whatever they are talking about ? ?
Conchita wondered .
It bothered her that she probably would never know .
"Certainly , she wouldn't dare ask her father afterward ."
He held a cigarette in his right hand .
"It was burning away , forgotten ."
His face was clouded with unhappiness .
"`` Let's hear it , anyway '' ."
`` Wait a little while .
Give her time to miss you .
Maybe she will then come to you .
`` John Clayton will see to that '' .
`` But after a time away from you .
''
"`` A year , Luis ? ?"
Five ? ?
Ten ? ?
How long should I wait '' ? ?
"`` Maybe in a year , Tomas ."
''
Hernandez looked suddenly uncertain .
Brannon looked at Hank Maguire .
`` And you ? ?
What would you do in my place '' ? ?
Hank shook his head .
"`` I don't know , Tom ."
"With Maria and me , there's never any problem ."
You're going to need your woman .
And the boy will need his mother .
Brannon shook his head .
But I'm going to have my son '' .
"`` All right '' , Brannon said , rising ."
Those who had slickers donned them .
It was to be nothing more than that .
There was to be no gunplay .
He didn't want to put himself outside the law .
The Ramirez brothers were also along .
They were all good men .
"It was dark early , because of the storm ."
Lighted windows glowed jewel-bright through the downpour .
He'd hoped to catch Jesse Macklin there .
"`` Probably just stepped out '' , he said ."
`` Maybe to have supper .
"Red , come along ."
The rest of you wait here '' .
`` Maybe he's at the hotel '' .
Brannon had no slicker .
But he felt no physical discomfort .
He was only vaguely aware of the sluicing rain .
Brannon dismounted and climbed the steps .
"`` He's finished eating '' , Hogan said ."
`` Sitting with a cup of coffee now .
It shouldn't be long '' .
"It seemed long , at least to Tom Brannon ."
"`` Just come along '' , Brannon told him ."
`` Don't start anything you can't finish '' .
"`` Now , listen '' -- Macklin began ."
`` We'll talk over at your office '' .
"`` Brannon , I warn you '' ! !"
Hogan gripped the lawman's other arm .
"`` I'll remember you '' , he said ."
`` Every last one of you .
"As for you , Brannon '' --"
"`` Now , hold on , damn it ; ;"
I won't '' --
Red Hogan's patience ran out .
"`` Too much fooling around '' , he said ."
"`` Don't press your luck , badge-toter '' ."
`` Key '' ? ?
Macklin said .
`` What for '' ? ?
`` Can't you guess '' ? ?
Brannon said .
Come on -- the key .
Get it out '' ! !
`` Damned if I will .
"Brannon , you've assaulted a law officer and '' --"
"He swore , and said , `` All right ."
It's here in my pocket '' .
"`` Get it out '' , Brannon ordered ."
"Resignedly , Macklin turned to the back door ."
It was secured by an oversized padlock .
Its windows glowed with lamplight .
The others followed Brannon inside .
Their presence fouled the elegance of that room .
He hadn't even pretended to be farming his spread .
His land had never been plowed .
He had cursed at them and threatened them .
`` I'll be ready next time '' ! !
He raged .
`` I'll be shootin' right back '' .
He exploded .
`` That's all I ask '' ! !
He never got that chance .
It took some time to locate Horn .
But that indictment was never made .
The former scout's alibi couldn't be shaken .
The authorities had to release him .
He'd grin .
"Publicly , he denied everything ."
The rustling problem was by no means solved .
The hired man ran over to help his boss .
"`` My God , I'm shot '' ! !"
Powell gasped .
And he collapsed and died instantly .
Ross had no intention of searching for the assassin .
There were no tracks of either hoofs or boots .
Not even an empty cartridge case could be found .
"He had lots of friends , then as always ."
`` Sportin' '' ! !
The tall sunburnt rustler-hunter stared in amazement .
`` Sportin' '' ! !
He echoed again in soft wonder .
The lesson had been learned .
The examples were plain .
"Keane left , within three days ."
)
"Brenner's voice was oily , but Summers wasn't fooled ."
He moistened his lips uneasily .
Brenner shrugged carelessly .
`` It's very simple .
Tell her to come here to the hotel '' .
"`` One thing , Summers '' , Brenner said ."
`` You're not to mention my name .
Tell her Curt Adams wants to see her '' .
"Summers pulled up short , and turned around ."
`` Eagle's Nest ought to have a fire company .
Tell her to hurry '' .
`` Yes sir '' .
"His face pale , Summers headed for the street ."
Curt snuffed out the match .
Curt moved over beside the door and waited .
''
The horse continued to snort .
"Jess cursed again , and entered the barn ."
"`` Before you try anything '' , he said ."
`` Remember what happened to Gruller '' .
Jess caught his breath in surprise .
"`` That's the stuff '' , Curt said ."
`` Just hold it that way '' .
You won't be needing this '' .
`` We ain't got nothing to talk about .
`` Your trigger-happy brother isn't in the house .
About now he's probably having supper .
Jess turned .
`` Arbuckle '' ? ?
Jess stiffened .
`` I don't know nothin' about him '' .
`` No ? ?
Now start talking .
Who told you to do it ? ?
Was it Dutch Brenner '' ? ?
Curt was holding Jess's gun in his left hand .
`` No '' ? ?
He retreated a step and holstered his own .
"`` All right , Crouch ; ;"
we're on even terms .
Now draw '' ! !
Sweat bubbled out on Jess's swarthy face .
`` I heard how you outdrew Chico .
I ain't a gunslinger '' .
`` No .
I just wanted to hear you say so '' .
"Somewhere in the distance , a woman screamed ."
He dropped his own beside it .
It was like hitting a sack of salt .
It gave Curt time to stagger to his feet .
His aim was hurried ; ;
so the pitchfork whistled over Curt's head .
By now Curt was seeing clearly again .
They made Jess double over .
What's going on out there '' ? ?
Jess didn't seem too sure himself .
Jess had had enough .
`` Tell me about Arbuckle ! !
"You killed him , didn't you '' ? ?"
`` He found out about you and Arbuckle talking .
The buckskin bolted out of the stall .
Curt moved in and picked up his gun .
"`` Get up , Crouch ."
We're going someplace '' .
`` Who's in there '' ? ?
Black called fearfully .
`` You're staying right here for a while .
This dirty coward just admitted killing Arbuckle .
`` Get out of here .
Jess stumbled through the door .
`` Where're you takin' me '' ? ?
Jess asked worriedly .
`` We're going to Marshal Woods's house .
"`` Honey '' , he whispered ."
His wounds need dressing now '' .
Jackson was doing most of the talking .
But his only hat was something else again .
`` Nate ! !
Nate '' ! !
He shouted .
`` Nate '' ! !
`` I know you ain't '' ! !
"Dan affirmed , feeling ten feet tall ."
Sally left her choring to stand beside Dan .
At first Matilda could not believe her own eyes .
Pa ! !
I can see Dan .
And he's with the Jacksons '' ! !
`` What about Burnsides '' ? ?
`` They ain't even in sight '' ! !
She replied .
"`` Nor Methodists , neither '' , she replied ."
"But she couldn't , not yet ."
"Next morning , they moved on again ."
`` My souls' a-gracious '' ! !
`` That wasn't nothing at all '' ! !
`` I ain't ragging him '' ! !
"`` Rheumatics worse , Pa '' ? ?"
"Dan grinned , and changed the subject ."
Pat only nodded .
Cobb's assent was tight .
`` You do the same .
"It's all I ask , Stevens '' ."
Fierce anger surged through Russ .
Stevens was nowhere in sight .
"`` What luck , Cobb '' ? ?"
He said swiftly .
Russ pointed upward .
Pat pushed through first .
His eyes widened .
Carmer himself was nowhere to be seen .
`` Where yuh goin' '' ? ?
It was the barkeep .
"Halting , Pat turned to survey him deliberately ."
He said no more .
Pat moved into it .
The door was locked .
"A single kick made it spring open , shuddering ."
Russ sprang through to bat it nimbly aside .
With a bellow Carmer lunged at him .
"He started to struggle up , heaving desperately ."
"`` Okay , Stevens ."
"I've drawn his fangs '' , he snapped ."
"`` Go through his pockets , will you ? ?"
Cobb got it .
`` Look at this '' ! !
Carmer's ingenious cache for his loot had been found .
"`` By golly , Stevens ! !"
Pat grunted .
`` Where else would he get it ? ?
"Count what you've got there , Cobb ."
We can soon tell '' .
Pat nodded .
His glance at Gyp Carmer was disdainful .
`` Shall we get out of here '' ? ?
Neither spoke till they reached their horses .
He started to return it .
To his faint surprise Russ held up his hand .
"`` Not me '' , he ruled decidedly ."
I've had enough .
`` I'll shove along home '' .
`` Whatever you say '' .
"`` Old Crip wasn't '' , retorted Cobb tartly ."
`` He'll know when you tell him .
But I want this to sink in awhile .
"Pat let him go , following more leisurely ."
He asked himself .
but on the range gunfire had a meaning .
"Hauling up , Russ listened carefully ."
He tightened up in a twinkling .
What did it mean ? ?
He knew now what he was up against .
`` Over this way ! !
He ain't gone far '' ! !
A harsh cry floated to him across the brush .
The would-be assassin had his position figured pretty close .
"Dismounting , Russ looked about hastily ."
Toward the west this depression led toward a draw .
A slug had torn half of his stirrup-guard away .
Another snarled close overhead .
`` Jumping Jerusalem ! !
Let's get out of here '' ! !
Yet he must chance it .
Anything the enemy flew or floated was his target .
Each plane carried two five-hundred pound bombs .
No one had much to say .
The sky glowered down at them .
`` But this goddamn climate .
It's for carabao not airplanes '' .
`` We'll make out .
`` Yeah .
The pilots' heads looked ridiculously small .
He shivered in the warm cockpit .
The overcast was solid above him .
Greg pushed the radio button on his throttle .
The formation remained perfect .
`` Somebody beat us to it '' ! !
It was frustrating .
The low clouds made bombing difficult .
The accuracy was deplorable .
"Mercifully , it was still open ."
Three bogies .
Twelve o'clock level '' .
Greg's eyes flicked up from his instrument panel .
Friend or enemy ? ?
The same old question .
And only a few seconds to answer it .
`` Zeros '' ! !
"Todman said excitedly , and hopefully ."
And then he thought Todman might be right .
"In seconds , Greg made his decision ."
He pushed the radio button .
"`` Sweeney Blue , hit the deck ."
Lots of throttle .
"Todman , you take the one on the left ."
I'll take the middle .
"Belton , the one on the right ."
If they're Japs .
Let's make sure first '' .
The opposing aircraft continued to come on .
They appeared to be the enemy .
It was a box .
But they could turn and escape to the east .
Greg pushed the radio button again .
"`` Todman , drop your second element back ."
Now let's make sure they're Japs '' .
His hands shook .
"`` Arm your guns , Sweeneys '' ."
`` They're Japs .
"They're Japs '' , came a high-pitched voice ."
`` Greg to Sweeney Blue .
One pass only .
No turns .
You'll bust your ass in this canyon .
That's an order '' .
He moved the flights over against one wall .
`` They haven't seen us '' .
He hit the radio button .
"`` Now , Sweeneys , now ."
Let's take 'em home '' .
"Perfect , he thought ."
He tightened his turn .
His nose up .
It was going to be dangerous .
Eight aircraft in this small box .
The enemy did not veer .
Blind fools .
Now ! !
Greg's fingers closed on the stick trigger .
The plane rumbled and slowed .
Greg tightened his turn until the plane shuddered .
Luck was with him .
The Jap's propeller flew off in pieces .
A large piece of engine cowling vanished .
It was all Greg had time to see .
His speed was dropping rapidly .
"Wingman , stay clear , he prayed ."
He fought the panic of vertigo .
He held the controls where they had been .
`` Gracias .
Then I saw the father's head slightly turn ; ;
gauche rainbow shapes replaced the poignant ovals of gold .
Autos whizzed past .
Damn his luck .
It was stopping .
I nodded .
"`` Onleh one thiihng '' , Mrs. Roebuck continued ."
How far I knew will shortly become apparent .
"`` No , I don't '' , Johnson said ."
"`` I'm a good Baptist , and drinking ''"
And re-echo .
"`` Get in , buddies ."
Get in '' .
The truck was hurtling forward .
Whatever satisfaction that might offer .
Something pulled my leg .
`` Wanna beer '' ? ?
Did I want a beer ? ?
Did an anteater want ants ? ?
"`` Bueno , amigo ."
I wouldn't have known the difference .
Prairie dogs were popping up and popping down .
This time no wire came whipping into the truck .
We were back on the road .
`` That was Tee-wah I was talking .
I nodded .
`` Drink your beer '' .
The beer foamed furiously .
I drank furiously .
A long time .
Emptied the bottle .
I bobbed my head each time it appeared .
I tossed the bottle .
Too high .
`` Aye-yah-ah-ah '' ! !
We were slowing .
The car was approaching fast .
`` S-s-sahjunt '' .
Brakes shrieked behind us .
I quickly turned around and began to drink .
But the Indian was jabbing another bottle toward Johnson .
And what eyes they were .
"Big and dark , a melting , golden brown ."
"Eyes like hot honey , eyes that sizzled ."
`` I'm sorry .
Shall I go on '' ? ?
She smiled .
It was her first smile .
But worth waiting for .
`` Sure '' .
I said .
"`` No , thanks '' ."
She was wearing nothing beneath the coat .
`` I forgot '' ! !
She yelped .
"`` Oh , do forgive me ."
I'm sorry '' ! !
`` I forgive '' --
"Oh , dear , I'm all unstrung '' ."
"`` You and me both , dear ."
Haven't we haven't I seen you .
"I mean , surely we've '' --"
`` I've done several filmed commercials for '' --
Then it hit me .
`` Zing '' ! !
I cried .
"`` Why , yes ."
And you recognized me '' ? ?
"`` Yes , indeed ."
"What's your name , anyway ? ?"
"Ah , you were splendid '' ."
I sat by her on the divan .
`` Splendid .
In a waterfall and all that '' .
`` That's the last one we did .
That was a fun one '' .
`` I'll bet .
"It was fun for me , all right ."
I mean : Is advertising honest ? ?
`` It depends on who does it .
I never wear anything at all .
"It wouldn't -- wouldn't seem fair , somehow '' ."
`` I couldn't agree with you more '' .
About the murder '' .
`` Murder ? ?
"Oh , yeah '' , I said ."
`` Tell me about the murder '' .
She told me .
", Inc. ."
even to clean men and boys .
And he didn't have any clothes on '' .
`` He didn't '' ! !
"`` Yes , he didn't ."
"Did , I mean '' ."
She paused .
"`` You got away , didn't you '' ? ?"
`` Yes .
`` I didn't know .
I wouldn't have the stuff in the house .
But I'm pleased to hear '' --
`` So I just scooted out of his clutches .
She went on :
"`` No , I never did see his face ."
But I'm sure the other one was Lou '' .
Or at least not to Joyce .
I could show what I can do '' .
Joyce squirmed a little on the divan .
"`` I'm starting to itch '' , she said ."
`` Itch '' ? ?
"Mmmm , it sure itches '' ."
"`` Oh , I'd love to '' ."
That always relaxes me .
Doesn't it you '' ? ?
`` Only when I do it '' .
I shook my head .
"`` Soak as long as you want , Joyce ."
"So you'll have everything all to yourself , doggone ''"
I looked at my watch .
Ten after nine .
"Time to go , I supposed ."
"`` Well , goodbye '' , I said ."
`` Goodbye .
You'd better hurry '' .
"`` Oh , you can count on that '' ."
She smiled slightly .
Softly .
Warmly .
`` Don't hurry too much .
That was all she said .
Hot water .
She wouldn't be taking a cold shower .
"Hell , she couldn't ."
Lights blazed in the big house and surrounding grounds .
`` How'd you hear about this one '' ? ?
"I grinned , but ignored the question ."
He didn't push it ; ;
He filled me in .
`` What were they doing here '' ? ?
I asked Rawlins .
What is the gunk '' ? ?
`` How would I know ? ?
It's a secret .
`` Can't say yet .
`` I'll pick murder .
Anything else '' ? ?
The arrangement turned out to be excellent .
She looked more like twenty-five or six .
It was really a May and December combination .
"the calf was magnificent , the ankle perfect ."
That she impressed me instantly was obvious ; ;
You have probably experienced this .
Why she married him I do not know .
some women with father fixations do .
his bride opened the store .
`` He will not always be indisposed '' .
`` I know .
I was thinking about that .
How will we work it out '' ? ?
"`` I don't know '' , she said ."
`` You're the man .
You figure it out .
`` I guess we both felt it '' .
I said .
"`` I guess so '' , she said ."
`` But now what '' ? ?
She raised a protesting hand with a startled air .
`` What are you trying to do ? ?
Get thrown out ? ?
She said incredulously .
Tomorrow Mardi Gras opens officially .
There will be romance and flirtation .
You are both the same size .
`` But you '' -- she began .
`` Don't worry about me .
It will turn out all right '' .
"`` I don't understand '' , she insisted ."
I must say the figure was well made up .
I suspected why he brought it along .
`` You cheap bitch '' ! !
I exclaimed .
You should -- smack ! !
-- be ashamed of yourself .
He had better write a postcard to Walter .
Dammit ! !
He inwardly cried .
His hand was large and square and heavily tanned .
He had returned to the pension a week ago .
He was determined to spend an industrious summer .
"Well , maybe Manas wouldn't call ."
Should she wake him ? ?
She didn't have the heart .
She was just not able to break the spell .
Mary Jane Lerner knew none of this .
The next day he was gone .
`` How like him '' ! !
Mary Jane had smilingly said .
She set down her suitcase .
Should she wake him ? ?
No .
The sun grew hotter as it approached the midday .
He began sweating .
His nose was tickled .
He sneezed .
He blew his nose expertly between his fingers .
He spit .
"He belched , he stretched ."
She had retreated to this world .
Families are very interesting .
"Nevertheless , there is no bath ."
And then we shall see .
)
You shall see her at dinner '' .
"A thing he did not like doing , generally ."
Mary Jane had made very little effort .
The result was grace and modesty .
Meredith began falling in love .
Soup : `` Only this morning '' ; ;
; ;
; ;
a smile .
`` What a beautiful room .
Like as if it were built of books '' .
`` Those sweet girls ? ?
Oh you're joking .
It tastes a little like poppyseed .
What's its name ? ?
) But he read on .
I can never pronounce it '' .
She repeated `` Eurydice '' .
The third time rather urgently .
But with her hand poem again .
They finished the small bottle of Steinhager .
They smiled .
The third time rather urgently .
Molten glare singed their eyelids an angry crimson ; ;
`` Hoa-whup '' ! !
He spat .
He cleared his throat and wet his lips .
But it was water .
"Thank the Lord , they still had water ! !"
He cleansed his mouth with a small quantity .
He took a long but carefully controlled draught .
She asked smolderingly .
`` There must be some water under there '' .
`` And add fever to our troubles '' ? ?
She scoffed .
"`` We can boil it '' , he said ."
Her chin sharpened .
`` The tires are rattling on the wheels now .
They'll roll off in another day .
There was no valley like this on your map .
You don't even know where we're headed '' .
"Somewhere , we'll hit a trail '' ."
`` Somewhere ! !
'' She repeated .
His wide mouth compressed .
"In a way , he couldn't blame her ."
She had hated the whole idea before they started .
`` Don't try to be noble '' ! !
Her laugh was hard .
He winced .
He darkened under his heavy burn .
"To his puzzlement , there suddenly was no haze ."
"He hollered hoarsely , `` Hang on '' ! !"
And goaded the oxen as he yelled .
He swung up over the wheel .
But she sat on in stubborn silence .
The six-ton Conestoga began to whip and shake .
Their world turned black .
The cloudburst cut off abruptly .
The water level was higher than their hubs .
Clumps of brush rode down the ribbon .
"At least , the wheels dug in ."
His wife didn't give a sign she'd heard .
Somebody was riding the tree .
She did not call out .
The pale blob of the woman disappeared .
`` There's the one who's lucky '' ! !
The girl murmured harshly .
They were already swollen to bursting .
The oxen might as well enjoy it .
Hope surged within him .
"Still , he felt better ."
A tight wagon meant so much .
Their jams and jellies had not suffered .
That's a good trunk .
If you want to get them aired ''
The lifeboats were stuck fast .
We couldn't budge them .
Heave on those ropes ; ;
the boat's come unstuck '' .
our muscles were hot wires of pain .
Brassnose was strangely silent .
We'd be in real trouble then .
I'd rather keep bailing -- or sink '' .
He had been speaking of this archipelago :
`` I know something about Eromonga .
Let's hope we come to a safer place '' .
But we didn't .
A half-hour passed ; ;
we had drifted closer .
`` Tchalo ! !
I squinted at the looming shoreline .
A fine example of engineering in a primitive society .
`` Aaa-ee ! !
In ngandlu .
We are thirsty and hungry ; ;
You are welcome to Eromonga .
My people await you on the shore .
"You shall have food , water and rest '' ."
I looked .
Some had been there for years ; ;
There was one object which sickened yet fascinated me .
I looked with revulsion at the legs .
They were shattered .
"Later , you shall know it better ."
Is it not well-made ? ?
We are very proud of it '' .
"Not so soon , anyway ."
This was the worst thing I could have said .
They despise males who brag of their strength ; ;
they destroy such men with their damned tests .
"You've ruined me , blast you '' ! !"
The women's faces had hardened after my statement .
.
)
`` All men went away from here .
Those who stayed had to pass tests .
Few passed '' .
"Come , I show you '' ."
Maybe to beat up on his squaw '' .
He said to his partner .
`` You mean dream '' ? ?
`` Not exactly .
Just see it '' .
Never Benny .
`` You seen him yet '' ? ?
"Benson said , referring to the Indian ."
She wore shorts and a loose terry-cloth shirt .
`` What outfit does she drive for '' ? ?
Benson said .
She might have been someone he had once loved .
How would you ever see her again ? ?
Their work was lonely .
`` What's she doing in this bunch '' ? ?
The girl looked around at the countryside .
The two drivers moved closer .
Benson said to Ramey .
"`` He's dead , isn't he '' ? ?"
The man said .
There was nothing in particular on the man's face .
`` What's this '' ? ?
His words were mostly to himself .
`` Don't '' .
There was a gentle concern in Benson's voice .
`` But what is it '' ? ?
The man said with a tone of impatience .
But what is it ? ?
The man had spoken only once .
Them's brains '' .
He moaned and pulled the hand away .
Even yet there was no realization in his eyes .
He did not look around .
`` What happened '' ? ?
Someone said .
`` He's hurt '' ! !
The man on the ground began to move ; ;
She begged .
None of the crowd had stepped forward to help .
"She said , her voice rising ."
Ramey said nothing .
Behind Ramey feet scraped beneath sharp questioning whispers .
Ramey caught a glimpse of the insurance man .
"`` All right , step back '' ! !"
`` You all right '' ? ?
"But her hands were calm , now ."
"She's got guts , thought Keith ."
"Thank you , Keith '' ."
He smiled at her sincerity .
Strange .
Seven years they'd been married .
But her beauty always surprised him anew .
Isn't that so '' ? ?
Penny lowered her eyes .
didn't it ? ?
''
Penny did not answer .
Keith was snarling now .
And he loves you because you're a beautiful woman .
"All of us , that is , except me ."
"Well , why don't you say something '' ? ?"
Penny would not rise to his mood .
But Keith looked down more than up .
He knew how to shoot down Nazis .
"That was true , but only half the truth ."
He enjoyed the killing .
He enjoyed killing .
Not quite .
That was where he met Penny .
"Penny knew him better , on her part ."
Keith was an eagle .
Penny and Keith had no romance .
No dates or hand-holding .
"This time , they had been lucky ."
"The Command post was underground , and well camouflaged ."
"That is , everyone but Keith and Penny ."
The bomb was a solitary one .
"The chaplain married them , on the next day ."
He couldn't stop killing .
"That was his true love , not Penny ."
This is a paradise for hunters .
The great black leopards .
But there are big rogues in both countries .
They came upon cheetal deer at woodland pools .
"Peacocks strutted across their path , preening ."
The German courteously indicated that Robinson should mount first .
He was frowning .
So instead I come up '' .
`` Was it my equipment '' ? ?
The German asked .
He stared stonily at the floor .
`` I was down to 275 .
I've been that far half a dozen times .
So you turn around '' .
A note of awe came into his voice .
"`` That's right '' , Robinson said ."
"`` I was expecting it , sure ."
You don't head back down again .
"Not me , anyway ."
Not right away '' .
"`` Our boy didn't chicken out , no sir ."
He ran into the rapture of the depths .
Nitrogen narcosis .
It makes the diver feel drunk '' .
"`` Anyway '' , Waddell went on ."
`` It's nothing to fool with .
It can kill you .
"`` Nobody's giving anything up '' , Robinson said ."
and yet like a child among adults .
I'm going down again '' .
`` That's my boy '' ! !
Mr. Forsythe exclaimed .
"`` Excuse me '' , he said abruptly ."
`` Can I make you one '' ? ?
"Aloud he had said , making conversation :"
"`` Yes '' , Herr Schaffner had said ."
`` He's one hell of a decent boy .
I like that kid '' .
"`` I agree , yes '' ."
"`` Well , no '' , Herr Schaffner said ."
Waddell turned to face him .
`` No '' ? ?
He asked .
`` But that's what he told me .
`` What do you mean '' ? ?
"Waddell asked , frowning ."
`` Did you tell him all this '' ? ?
He asked .
`` But surely you have misunderstood Mr. Roy .
He was most eager to make the dive ; ;
"of course , I was willing ."
"`` Well , damn '' , Waddell said ."
He started out the door .
`` One moment '' ! !
Herr Schaffner said .
`` What else '' ? ?
Waddell asked .
Mr. Roy is determined to make this dive .
Whatever you tell him he will dive .
I know this from my talks with him '' .
Waddell said .
`` On the basis of the facts '' .
All tourists come to Florida .
Yes ! !
He took a big swig of his drink .
"`` Yes '' , the German said ."
`` At least for South Florida '' .
I guess you're right '' .
the rewards prompt and juicy in modern big-business America .
`` Join me in another '' ? ?
He had asked .
`` I do not drink so much '' .
Fear and relief mingled in his churning emotions .
crossed himself ; ;
"said a Hail Mary , slowly and with understanding ."
Make it come off all right .
Amen '' .
He crossed himself again and rose .
He felt a good deal less shaky .
"`` Well , I was a little bit confused ."
"Anyway , I wasn't down long enough to matter ."
Early that day Matsuo saw a marine .
Yesterday ; ;
today ; ;
tomorrow : no surrender .
It was best to die fighting the marines .
What if the marines never came ? ?
His comrades were all dead .
He had no rice .
His fingers touched the bone handle of a knife .
Besides the belt he wore a loin cloth .
Gloom receded .
A signal ? ?
The marines let him advance .
Matsuo repeatedly choked down his own nausea .
He strained his hearing .
Cautious feet stepping on leafmold ; ;
faint creaking of belts and slings ; ;
whispers : he heard none of these .
Humiliation made Matsuo tremble .
The shot reverberated in diminishing whiplashes of sound .
Hush followed .
How stupid to give his position away .
The jungle did not retort .
The sitter remained seated hugging the tree .
It ended when he tumbled ; ;
The pockets of his jacket bulged .
Hand grenades .
They could come on him now without difficulty .
Gradually he reached a conclusion .
Matsuo jumped when the hidden arm flopped out .
Reflex ? ?
He was bearded .
One by one he tossed the objects aside .
Too bad the marine had no water .
From its holder he took his own canteen .
"So , alive ."
Matsuo put the bottle to his own lips .
The marine reached up a hand .
Matsuo shook his head .
`` None for you '' .
"The marine blinked , soon dropping his hand ."
`` You came well equipped to die '' .
Some odor made him lean over the man .
He sniffed and recognized it .
Sake .
So that had been his difficulty .
`` Be a good turtle '' .
The marine shut his eyes .
"He waited in his squat , gripping the hair ."
Every so often he turned the knife .
Its blade was dazzling in the intense sunlight .
Matsuo shook his head .
Strange .
At last he reached for the knife .
The marine yelled and flung the hand away .
burned the other cheek ; ;
burned each hand when they came groping again .
Matsuo stood up .
"`` A small measure of payment , marine '' ."
He ceased weeping .
"Matsuo walked toward his tree , once glancing back ."
The marine was still .
He would soon die .
What now ? ?
Someone called .
He cupped his mouth and yelled .
Matsuo hustled the rifle off his shoulder .
"He aimed , but listened ."
`` Sake '' ? ?
Matsuo called .
The marine nodded vigorously .
"Matsuo laughed , slung the rifle ."
The marine was a winehead .
His superiors had said that all marines were depraved .
One swallow was all he would have ; ;
Of course it was water he really craved ; ;
Matsuo shook his head .
He had no water for an enemy .
He capped the bottle and replaced it .
Before much longer the marine quieted down .
His head slumped .
The upper part of his packet had stained dark .
`` Marine .
"There is nothing for you '' , Matsuo said ."
I've nothing for you '' .
He asked .
The stranger ignored him .
`` Because I'm asking .
Blue Throat winked at his six cronies .
"`` The kid has no manners , boys ."
Shall we teach him some '' ? ?
A third shot doused the light .
And I aim to have it '' .
"`` OK , Tilghman , I'm quitting '' ."
Somebody brought a light .
I've come for Pat Conyers' body '' .
Blue Throat won't stand for this .
He'll shoot up the town '' .
The prediction was correct .
He sized up the situation and shook his head .
Billy returned with six sticks of dynamite .
Billy Tilghman did just that .
"`` Wait here , Neal '' , said Tilghman ."
"`` Hello , Ed '' , said Tilghman ."
The rancher grunted an acknowledgement but didn't move .
"Thinking fast , Tilghman never hesitated for one instant ."
Can't seem to locate landmarks in this snow '' .
The rancher was trembling .
He wouldn't look Tilghman in the face .
`` Jed's homestead is on the south bank '' .
We'll let him go '' .
"All , that is , except Jack ."
then he slowed to a walk .
The vision became even stronger now .
`` I've got to get her '' .
"`` What's the matter , honey '' ? ?"
`` Aren't you hungry '' ? ?
He felt a little sick at his stomach .
`` Are you sick '' ? ?
"`` No '' , he said ."
`` I'll be all right .
I guess it's this hot weather '' .
`` Don't you play hard today then .
"`` Whaddya say , boy '' ? ?"
`` No .
What '' ? ?
His heart beat faster .
`` Hell you say '' ? ?
`` How'd you do it '' ? ?
"`` Hell , I jist ask her '' ."
`` Jist like that '' ? ?
"`` Hell , yes ."
`` I never heard that '' .
`` It's all over Branchville .
`` Let's go inside '' .
`` Maybe at dinner time .
Come inside now '' .
Jack watched Miss Langford all morning .
`` Why ain't you playin' ball '' ? ?
Presently she came out of the schoolhouse .
I didn't mean to pull so hard '' .
`` It was my fault '' .
One of the little girls said .
`` No more today .
Maybe some other day '' .
"`` Oh , shucks '' , the girl said ."
To his surprise his plan worked perfectly .
He scarcely saw them .
The dance was of Haitian origin .
Delphine was a pace-setter in high society .
"`` What is your name , boy ? ?"
Come a bit closer .
"I won't bite , you know '' ."
Then he smiled shyly .
"`` My name is Dandy Brandon , missy ."
I belong to Master Alexander Prieur '' .
`` Aristide ! !
There's $600 in gold in this chamois sack .
"Besides , he owns 300 slaves ."
One less shouldn't matter to him '' .
"`` Another youth , Madame '' ? ?"
The coachman said softly .
"Such delicate beauty , such fine flesh ."
It will rip and shred easily for Madame '' .
"`` Be quiet , Devol ! !"
You are forgetting your place '' .
He was about 50 years old .
"`` Another young man , my dear ? ?"
"`` Quite so , my dear ."
His room will be ready shortly '' .
But he liked the smell of Delphine's perfume .
His pinched face showed the ravages of malnutrition .
These were the last words he ever uttered .
The ball broke up in confusion .
Such a pitiful end '' ! !
The girl was not more than 16 .
The bleeding girl was tiring fast ; ;
Ever since all that .
Out and out and never to return again .
That was the day it ended .
"Hot , that was the word , hot ! !"
"A poet , yet ! !"
Zingggg-O ! !
`` Ah-ah '' ! !
`` None of that .
We run a respectable house here '' .
He held the black plastic kazoo lightly .
`` That crap is softer over here '' .
"The girl smiled , and started forward ."
We don't know this guy '' .
This guy was strictly from Outsville .
But nowhere ! !
`` What is with this vow jazz '' ? ?
"Feathertop inquired , lounging against the freight's vibrating wall ."
"`` We -- we eloped '' , Cappy said ."
His head came up and he said it defiantly .
"`` Well , congratulations '' ."
Feathertop made an elaborate motion with his hand .
These two were going to be easy pickins .
That was gonna be fun collecting ! !
But not just yet .
Feathertop was a connoisseur .
He grinned at them wolfishly .
`` And you know -- you're right '' ! !
Feathertop aimed a finger at him .
`` He's okay .
He's a nice guy '' .
He cleared his throat ; ;
"He had it all doped , of course ."
Hmm -- diddle ! !
Kitty inquired politely .
`` Where from '' ? ?
He mused .
`` Out .
I been riding train for a ways now '' .
Ernie found it immensely funny .
`` No ! !
She snapped at him .
`` I only said I was hungry .
We haven't had anything to eat all day '' .
"`` Whyn't ya say so , fellow travelers ! !"
"Why , we got dinner right here ."
Ernie crouched and opened the carpet bag .
"`` Yeah , but what're we gonna eat ? ?"
Charcoal '' ? ?
"`` Hot dogs , man ."
Almost immediately they began to sizzle .
He looked up and grinned .
"`` A Kroger's self-serve '' , he explained ."
`` I self-served '' .
"Nice kid , Ernie thought , too bad ."
Ernie asked .
He didn't want us to get married .
So we ran away '' .
This time even she did not answer .
"She looked down at her hands , too ."
It was my fault '' .
Cappy's head came around sharply .
"`` Your fault , hell ! !"
It was all my fault .
Ernie's eyebrows went up .
`` What's the matter '' ? ?
Cappy raged at himself .
Ernie nodded .
This was a slightly different matter .
"He remembered Midge , and the child ."
But these kids weren't like him .
Oh crap ! !
These are just another couple of characters to roll .
"What they got , you get ."
Now forget all this other .
`` Wanna drink '' ? ?
`` Yeah .
Now that you offer '' .
Ernie stared at the man .
He was big .
"Road gang , Ernie thought ."
Ernie hesitated a moment .
This character could break him in half .
And carried him backward in a footballer's tackle .
The blade came out with a snick ! !
Kitty screamed insanely and her face was white .
Help him ! !
Do something '' ! !
They neither liked nor disliked the Old Man .
The Old Man was unimportant .
Or the bay of female dogs in heat .
Youth obeyed when commanded .
Once the Old Man had had a wife .
"And once she , too , ignored him ."
"`` No , no ."
Not that one .
"`` Eh , Torino ! !"
She gave herself fancy airs ! !
They had slapped their thighs .
`` Henh '' ! !
`` Puttana '' ! !
His voice had not commanded her to stop .
It had not questioned why .
( He was never without that dog .
To him they were one and the same .
The hedge reeked of coffee dregs thrown against it .
That was Bartoli's shop .
Did the Old Man remember them there ? ?
The Old Man silently fed upon these streets .
"They kept him alive , waiting ."
He was holding out for something .
He was determined to hold out .
He would not carry a brief case .
Nor would he work at all .
"`` Hey , Laura '' ! !"
She was only ten months older than he .
Laura did not answer him .
Her face showed no sign of having heard Pompeii .
He was never sure they fully took him in .
"Pompeii called again , `` Laura '' ! !"
Not even Laura .
"`` Christ sake , goat , git '' ! !"
But the goat would not .
"`` You're boiling milk , ain't you '' ? ?"
Pompeii rolled over .
But the boy could see only the goat's belly .
Time enough to give up his soul .
Little Anne rapidly outdistanced her mother in recovery .
"`` I should think so '' , Eugenia said ."
Maggie said .
`` I'm sorry .
"`` Well , let's see ."
Let's make a list of your assets '' .
`` What else '' ? ?
"`` What about a tea room , then ? ?"
`` It's too elaborate .
Eugenia sighed .
Maggie laughed .
"She said , `` Oh Eugenia , I wish ''"
`` What '' ? ?
`` All of them for you '' .
There weren't facilities to take care of them ; ;
"Shivering , people talked and argued ; ;"
Something had to be done ; ;
Something had to be done .
They lived mainly in the kitchen ; ;
`` Thrifty of her to use it up .
"Unusual in a case like this , but '' --"
`` You can joke ! !
Didn't you read it ? ?
She's married that tenant ! !
''
"`` I read it , yes ."
This ought to simplify Tolley's life '' .
Laban had more to say .
Tolley had gone to live in California .
Kizzie turned to go inside .
The sun's right '' --
`` Pictures '' ? ?
She swung around .
`` What pictures '' ? ?
`` In Brace's room ! !
You told me to bring my camera .
I'm not going back '' --
`` Indeed you are ! !
"`` Hurry , Frank ! !"
Tolley's going is my fault .
I drove him away .
He kissed her .
`` I'll decide that when I get there .
"I was so cruel to Tolley , so unfair ."
But I'll be fair now ! !
"Yes , oh yes ."
What else was there to say ? ?
`` Under the window in stormy weather
I marry this man and woman together .
Let none but Him who rules the thunder
Put this man and woman asunder '' .
Absolution for his lie ? ?
`` Why lacerate the -- congregation '' ? ?
Surely now his beloved son could rest in peace .
`` To absent loved ones '' .
`` You could try .
And don't tell me you didn't at church Sunday .
I heard you '' ! !
"Her horse , rather ."
And what had happened ? ?
Gunny invariably tried to bite her .
Human birth was no novelty to Mr. Robards .
"Rhyme 'em up cute -- Arcilla , Flotilla ''"
Just wait till she saw the Mare's foal .
Handsomest colt in all Kentucky .
What about Royal Robards ? ?
`` Why don't you name him Jesus Christ ! !
'' She burst into tears .
Roy was deeply distressed .
He had a good idea why not .
Doc Dunne and Miss Sis had come .
There was an idea .
She hoped they were well .
I'll see word gets round '' .
`` Don't you dare ! !
''
"`` See for yourself , Miss Zion ."
It won't take a minute '' .
He swung in through his own wide gateway .
She'll relish the sight of a friendly face .
Perhaps Doaty had guessed already and kept her counsel .
Mama was vulnerable ; ;
"But I would have gone anyway , thought Henrietta ."
Impossible to imagine Adelia feeling so about anyone .
"No temptation , no sin ."
"No temptation , no virtue ? ?"
A curious thought to end a curious night .
"To a Blackwell , there was only one church ."
`` It's my dryin' out time '' .
He scowled at her flowers .
It's dryin' myself out that does it '' .
He regarded her with rising hope .
`` Y're welcome '' .
It rests the tissues '' .
He looked up at her sharply .
"`` Don't remember , do you '' ? ?"
`` Y're the young Blackwell woman .
I know all about you '' .
Any harm in that '' ? ?
"`` Probably '' , said Henrietta dryly ."
`` Milk and sops '' ! !
`` He's got this idea about drying out ''
`` It ain't an idea '' ! !
His grand-daughter sighed .
"`` Come on , do ."
`` To the graveyard .
Who ain't '' ? ?
`` Not me .
I've got a day's work to do .
Henrietta nodded .
How much they knew about her ! !
Come on now '' .
Apparently they were of Caucasian blood .
They had white skins and blue eyes ; ;
Tommy Momoyama was one of these fortunate occasions .
She had been in Japan just one week .
There was nothing wrong with her job .
Tommy had been assigned to the psychopathic ward .
But she suffered in her off-duty hours .
Probably off one of the carriers -- an aviator .
"`` Harro , girl-san '' ! !"
`` You catchee boy-furiendo ? ?
Maybe you likee date with me '' ? ?
`` I beg your pardon '' ! !
Tommy said out of her cold rage .
`` Oh -- I'm sorry ! !
Tommy interrupted furiously .
`` All wrong ones '' ! !
"`` Take off , fly-boy '' ! !"
`` Uh -- sorry '' ! !
"She felt like a fool , too ."
"She looked around , self-consciously ."
For one cup of coffee .
Seeing these did nothing for Tommy's mood .
"And so she was , and would remain ."
Tommy wouldn't know ; ;
One thing was becoming increasingly sure .
Eating while angry had given her a slight indigestion .
It was all true .
"In his opinion , Doc had not grown up ."
The lieutenant was not entirely wrong in the belief .
"Whitey exclaimed , with true affection ."
`` Come over and have a drink .
We live down by the Base commissary .
Grab a taxi '' .
See you in about an hour '' .
The telephone rang .
Wow .
"`` Hi , Buzz '' , Owen said ."
Imagine a stag dinner with Toodle Williams '' .
He laughed and laughed .
"`` Yes '' , Owen called out ."
`` Yes '' ? ?
Probably saw me in the lobby .
`` How do you do '' ? ?
"She said , semi-professionally ."
`` Oh '' ? ?
`` Why is that '' ? ?
She apparently wasn't satisfied with his reaction .
"Smug , Owen thought , smug and sappy ."
"It gave her a lewd , winking effect ."
"She asked , winking wildly ."
She smiled in a sickly-tolerant fashion .
"`` You know , that's very interesting ."
"Forebearing , Owen kept his peace ."
What would happen next ? ?
He asked curiously .
"`` Oh , I just come once a week ."
Every day I visit a different hotel .
I feel it's my duty .
I have the whole Pacific Northwest '' .
Mrs. Gertrude Parker drew back .
`` You're in the secular world '' .
`` I didn't say it was Christian .
I don't think you'll find many active Christian salesmen .
Not that religion isn't big business ; ;
Our key salesmen are in appliances and cosmetics '' .
It sounded silly ; ;
why go on ? ?
More people were passing ; ;
`` Don't forget whiskey ; ;
it's such a big seller '' .
I have an appointment '' .
"`` I can imagine '' , she said ."
`` Probably down at the bar .
They must be freezing up there now .
Can't you help them '' ? ?
`` Leave a card or something .
I'll think it over '' .
he heard her knocking on another door .
then he realized he was hungry .
"He felt suddenly elated , adventurous ."
The way was opening up ; ;
The Golden Calf was dimly lit with shaded neon .
She sighed a dirty word and left .
`` You can't build on your hit-and-miss five-seventeen '' .
`` What are you playing '' ? ?
Owen asked .
"`` I'm just logging '' , the cowboy explained ."
But roulette's not my game .
`` Nice to know you .
"`` Well , of course I do ."
He's a pinto and he photographs wonderfully '' .
His adventurous spirit had waned ; ;
He had no great prejudice against shills ; ;
it just seemed such a dry run .
There was no cash around ; ;
everyone was flipping silver dollars .
Owen found Buzz watching chuck-a-luck .
He was knocking down checks at faro '' .
"`` I'm allergic to Tahoe '' , Owen explained ."
`` Something about the pollen '' .
"`` Well , okay '' , Buzz said ."
`` We'll see you around later '' .
"`` How's your luck , honey '' ? ?"
I'll make them dance the tango .
"`` Sounds like real love '' , Owen said ."
`` Named after the ballet .
Spencer said nothing .
Spencer shook his head .
`` Very well '' .
Alexander walked away .
Hostile glances were flashed at both Alexander and Gansevoort .
The two met in the Captain's cabin .
"`` More arrests , I fear '' ."
"`` Cromwell , of course ."
`` Have him come in '' .
Adrien Deslonde hastened to Alexander's side .
"I swear it , sir '' ."
"Wales said , `` Of course they would ."
We are going to be rushed and murdered '' .
"`` That is extravagant language , Mr. Wales ."
The instinct of discipline has been lost .
`` We ourselves must stand sentinel '' .
Alexander said .
Where had he failed ? ?
How had he failed ? ?
It was given or it was not given .
Now the hope was gone .
"Dear God , at what a price ."
"`` Are you , Cromwell '' ? ?"
"`` Yes , sir ."
Before God I swear I am innocent .
You were careful about that '' .
He is innocent '' .
Alexander shifted his gaze to Spencer .
This tragic lad had forged his own shackles .
He was your constant companion '' .
The hazel eyes met Alexander's .
`` I tell you he is innocent '' .
`` Yes .
I have nothing to gain by defending Cromwell '' .
"`` Nothing to lose , either , Spencer '' ."
His eyes went back to contemplation of the sea .
The boatswain was as guilty as any .
Bits of trash lay in the roadway .
The air smelled warmish and foul .
I was suddenly conscious of my bare arms .
Rachel had seen me watching the young man .
She smiled .
Like the ones you will see now '' .
She led me into a twisting side alley .
Rachel talked to him .
His toes pointed out toward the walls .
We stepped inside .
He left us .
One white hand poised a stick above his desk .
Rapping the stick against the desk .
The boys were tiny .
The guttural language from the ghetto stopped .
His head barely rose above the table .
I stared at him for a long time .
He did not return my interest .
His body pitched back and forth on the bench .
His front teeth were missing .
I shuddered and backed out of the room .
We walked down the cool hall silently .
"`` All day '' , she said ."
I rubbed my hands together .
They had turned numb and prickly in the classroom .
"Rachel said , `` He asks for money '' ."
She passed by him .
He thanked me .
I didn't look at him .
I grinned at Rachel .
`` Does this bother you '' ? ?
I said .
She smiled to herself .
`` Most of our Sabras think it's horrible .
I was amazed .
You had to be stupid or crazy or immortal .
And I wasn't .
I was American .
I resented them .
Rachel faced me .
Her bright eyes were twinkling .
Your mother hated this way of life .
In this section '' ? ?
Rachel clicked her tongue behind her teeth .
"`` Here , nothing ."
She loved the children .
"She was a strange woman , your mother ."
She stayed here to work for Aliah .
Sometimes it was dangerous for her '' .
Rachel grinned slyly .
`` But she loved danger .
She took it with her wherever she went ; ;
she chose it .
She was most strange woman .
Ready to follow her impulse .
Here they did not need to be in ghettos .
I'd like to know that very much '' .
Rachel clasped her hands together and slowed her pace .
But she sighed and her face relaxed .
`` Trouble came into her life .
Who loved her .
But she had to go out and hurt herself .
There was a man here in town .
She worked very hard .
He came with his son .
Yet he walked like a young man .
She ran from a little group of us .
"We were sitting together , talking ."
Rachel paused .
It was silent in the stone alley .
No one saw her except the man Reuveni '' .
"`` Yes '' , I said ."
`` I know him '' .
"Rachel gave me a direct , bright-eyed look ."
He said she would only hurt herself .
She came to me one day .
She was pale and skinny ; ;
she was terribly alone .
He would never let her harm herself again .
She let him lead her around .
Reuveni took her with him wherever he went .
He did not let her talk to people ; ;
he did not let her choose her own food .
She was limp and beaten from her loss ; ;
she did not care .
`` And I'll take you with me '' .
The two of them against the world .
That had been how she imagined it .
But now the dream was over .
The big waking up had happened .
`` What did I imagine '' ? ?
She thought .
And I'll take you with me .
He had taken her all right .
Wednesday nights after youth fellowship .
You could wish that .
"If it is love , you don't ."
And I'll take you with me .
You feel him every mile further away .
"`` Damn the world '' , she thought ."
The mayor envisioned factories there .
Each of us had his own specialty besides .
"In the first place , it's static ; ;"
McKenzie was as happy as a clam .
"`` That's authenticity '' , he said ."
"As for Donald , he actually sold paintings ."
Not much ; ;
none of us did .
I wanted to paint again .
I had a long talk with him .
`` By yourself '' ? ?
I asked .
He made a circle with his thumb and fingers .
"`` Painting isn't this big , you know ."
"He threw his arms wide , his face shining ."
"The eye is all , inward or outward ."
`` What do you study '' ? ?
I asked .
I was fascinated ; ;
just listening to him made me feel intelligent .
`` Maybe you know him .
He teaches at the Manhattan School of Art '' .
I nodded .
Burns and I had not loved each other .
`` Osric Pendleton '' ? ?
I said .
"`` My God , is he still alive ? ?"
He must be a million years old .
`` Not quite '' .
Askington laughed .
"`` He's about sixty , now ."
"`` You're missing the point '' , he said ."
`` He has the magical eye .
And he is a great man .
Contact with him is stimulating .
And that's the trouble with so many artists today .
They lack stimulation .
But look at us today ! !
A bunch of amateur dervishes ! !
He could certainly talk .
"In a way , Askington was right ."
`` Stimulating '' was the word for it .
"No , that isn't quite fair ."
She asked .
"`` Via '' , she was frowning ."
`` Why should Via have it '' ? ?
I was silent .
I didn't want to stir things up .
You know that '' .
I'll call her '' .
"`` No , thank you ."
I want nothing of Via's '' .
Why should this suddenly assail her ? ?
I don't even own the house I'm standing in .
So I went about my business .
"`` Don't bother , Ida '' , she said ."
But the next day -- Sunday .
"`` She's nowhere , nowhere '' ! !"
And she .
Then the telephoning began .
Why didn't that alarm me then ? ?
But it seemed not from what they were saying .
I knew '' ! !
Everyone stared at me and drew back .
"Their eyes turned cold and accusing , even Via's ."
And they have never changed .
Was that what had given way in me ? ?
It is not their avoidance that rankles ; ;
She haunted me ; ;
`` It was nobody's fault .
She overplayed her hand '' .
`` What do you mean '' ? ?
She frowned .
I added .
Mr. Salter came home .
I waited .
`` Uhhu '' .
"`` Oh , I'd drink with newspaper people ."
`` Me '' ? ?
"She asked , turning slowly ."
`` What about me '' ? ?
`` Did you make friends easily '' ? ?
"`` Umm , uhhu '' ."
How about it '' ? ?
`` Are your people still alive '' ? ?
so he could have something of her for himself .
Where did you go to school '' ? ?
`` What is this '' ? ?
"She asked , turning suddenly ."
My name's Carla Caneli .
This is my town .
I sleep with you .
Why are you trying to worry me '' ? ?
`` I'm not trying to worry you '' .
"`` Well , all right then '' ."
He wondered .
`` What's the matter '' ? ?
She asked suddenly .
`` Nothing .
"Nothing at all '' , he said quietly ."
`` Let's go out '' .
`` What's the matter with them '' ? ?
`` The heavy thick soles .
Look at them '' .
I like them '' .
Can't you get another pair '' ? ?
`` What's the matter with it '' ? ?
"`` Oh , Sam ."
You look like a tweedy Englishman .
Then they took a taxi to Trastevere .
He let her tell him all about the church .
Then they had dinner .
All evening she was eloquent and pleased with herself .
She might like to take him to St. Peter's .
`` It's ten o'clock .
Aren't you going out to mass ? ?
You could take me to St. Peter's '' .
"`` Uhhu '' , she muttered ."
"`` Come on , you'll be late '' ."
It would be good for her .
Not his poor mother's fault .
Just figures out of a tribal folklore .
It was too bad he wasn't a Catholic himself .
"It was the times , he was sure ."
It was all too wearying .
Look somewhere else .
But where ? ?
There's so little to do '' .
`` Why not '' ? ?
She said .
`` This afternoon let's take an air with them .
`` I am what I am .
I can't help it '' .
"`` Ciao , '' and put out her hand ."
The Ferraros offered them biscuits with the coffee .
Carla translated .
Had Sam ever lived in a boxcar ? ?
She wanted to know .
An intellectual .
But very mystical too .
It was said that he had had a vision .
"No , he was indeed a saint now ."
There was a certain discontent among the cardinals .
Did Signor Raymond understand ? ?
`` It means so much to her .
"He cried out to her , his back turned ."
But she heard him go .
`` I shall call your father ! !
And it was not Pile of Clouds she meant .
"I will tell you to go , not begging ."
Telling you '' ! !
`` They do not have to face battle .
I will not let your evil in .
I will simply kill you first .
Now go '' ! !
`` Go back to your lodges '' ! !
He shouted .
And Early Spring seized the whip and said :
`` Get into your hovel '' ! !
He spat .
`` What worrisome thing happens ? ?
I thought I dreamed of wolves fighting '' .
Lie back and go to sleep .
But do not dream .
They all know your foolish name '' ! !
Sssshoo '' ! !
The sounds of an animal in rage and despair .
Move ! !
They came out and held their games and races .
He felt so much like laughing ; ;
"The ,"
"She stood , once more listening ."
She had never been here at this hour .
She had accomplished a miracle .
This was her place .
The hour couldn't change it .
They were becoming confused .
Oh God ! !
I wish so much someone loved me .
She had vanished ; ;
he must have slept again .
This room was like a prison .
He would not be indebted to Sam ! !
His fingers fumbled across the bandages .
They had left both of his eyes uncovered .
He was walking across to the bathroom .
He recognized his jacket and trousers .
The fabric was dark ; ;
the stains weren't too apparent ; ;
Sam would be amazed to find him gone .
Millie would have to understand .
She must have put his clothes in the closet .
He was on the verge of tears .
At least Alex had told him he wasn't dying .
Perhaps George Rawlings would be better off dead .
What time was it ? ?
He peered at his wristwatch .
"Strange , it was still running ."
A quarter to seven .
He was kneeling to tie his shoelaces .
His fingers felt absurdly thick and clumsy .
He barely knew himself .
"The surface , however , was perfectly white ."
He was drinking another glass of water .
It was after seven o'clock .
Who would take over ? ?
He entered the hallway .
He was actually walking down the stairs .
"`` Father , is that you '' ? ?"
George did not reply .
"`` Is that you , Father ? ?"
Who's there '' ? ?
For a moment he felt like a thief discovered .
She stood gazing at him .
`` Uncle George '' ! !
He was trying to smile at her .
`` Gosh ! !
"You shouldn't be up , should you '' ? ?"
I'm all set .
Just about to call a taxi '' .
She was wearing some sort of gray blazer .
`` I'm about to leave myself .
I'll drop you off '' .
`` You're leaving '' ? ?
`` Pietro's driving me .
I'm just finishing breakfast .
She asked him .
`` No .
"I just don't want anyone disturbed , Julie ."
That's my wish .
"It's quite a big one '' , he added ."
Or maybe a drink '' ? ?
He tried to see her face more clearly .
`` I'll just wait for you here '' .
He raised them .
Julia moved past .
`` I have to say good-bye upstairs .
I won't be long '' .
`` Not to anyone '' ? ?
`` No -- please .
It'll be so much easier '' .
`` All right '' She was staring at him .
"`` I'm fine , Julie ."
"Please , you just go ahead '' ."
She had disappeared .
He could feel a pulse pounding against the bandages .
Maybe I couldn't have called a taxi .
He could hear the footsteps overhead .
"He saw the suitcase , which Julia was holding ."
He stood up .
"`` Oh no '' , she said ."
`` I can manage '' .
She went ahead of him .
Outside the Lincoln was parked .
He could hardly believe he was getting in .
but that didn't matter .
yet her inflection seemed forced or rehearsed .
He could not stop to analyze .
He had never felt particularly close to her .
He took her hand .
That's in the opposite direction '' .
"`` I wish I did '' , he responded ."
`` Forget we ever knew what '' ? ?
She said nothing until Pietro had slackened their pace .
`` Does it '' ? ?
He asked .
"`` Yes , perhaps ."
His voice seemed thick and purposeless .
He relinquished her hand .
He could see the stone building where he lived .
Just a few more steps .
Abruptly he reached into his pocket .
"Yes , there was the key ."
She asked him .
For a moment he smiled .
"`` Yes , Julie dear ."
You've done me the greatest possible service .
By myself I'll be fine '' .
`` Take care of yourself then '' .
`` I will .
"You , also ."
Don't work too hard '' .
It was an automatic phrase ; ;
as he crossed through the courtyard he regretted it .
He should have discovered a more tender farewell .
"Someone shouted at him , `` Well ! !"
Will you look at George Rawlings ! !
What happened to you '' ? ?
Someone laughed .
George walked steadily ahead into his entry .
His bandages seemed on fire .
In the kitchenette the raw whiskey made him gasp .
He was telephoning .
"`` No , Millie , I'm home ."
"No , really , right as rain ."
Tell Sam not to worry about the car .
I'll get it hauled away .
"For God's sake , don't worry ."
That upsets me more than anything .
''
There was one more call to make .
"`` Joan , did I wake you '' ? ?"
He asked .
"`` Yes , I thought you'd probably be up ."
"Look , sweetheart , some fool was ."
Happened to be driving somewhat intoxicated last night .
"Oh hell no , I'm not in a hospital ."
Too bad a jury isn't involved .
I might struggle in for a jury .
I'd win hands down .
He's got all the facts .
What ? ?
`` Don't even send flowers .
I'll see you Wednesday .
`` I'll take you out to dinner .
Okay ? ?
''
He had put down the receiver .
A strange relationship between Joan Fulbright and himself .
Who knew about it ? ?
She had two tiny rooms on the second floor .
`` They make us conformists look good '' .
`` That's a peculiar way to think '' .
she knew that .
`` I love you .
Susan ready '' ? ?
Lucy listened .
"Obviously , Susan was not ."
`` Not yet .
`` She'd better step on it .
It's a long way to Websterville '' .
"as he looked at her , it registered anxiety ."
"`` You know '' , he said ."
Lucy did not believe him ; ;
Myra appreciated nothing .
Jim had put the thanks in his sister's mouth .
`` She should have told me herself .
Remember what happened the last time '' ? ?
`` That was an awfully long two weeks '' .
"You'll see , Myra's settling down '' ."
`` It depends on the widow '' .
Lucy had an idea that Myra loved it .
It was not that she disliked Cathy .
"The youngster drew her , troubled her depths ; ;"
"But Cathy was Myra's responsibility , not hers ."
Myra loved big cities ; ;
Lucy knew her too well to find it impossible .
Susan ! !
Get moving '' ! !
A startled piping sound returned .
"`` Don't yell at Susan '' , Lucy said ."
"`` Please '' , he said ."
Let's stay friends '' .
"But they weren't just friends , Lucy thought ; ;"
Lucy was sick of it .
Susan looked like an overwhelmed baby nurse ; ;
her arms were straining with a burden of dolls .
"`` I'm ready '' , she announced ."
`` Do you need that big bundle '' ? ?
Jim said .
`` All that junk '' ? ?
"`` Your father didn't mean it , Susan '' ."
`` She'll take every one of them '' .
Nice '' ? ?
the last one had been a Lilliputian war .
She turned and began to walk toward the house .
The handsome bird was solitary ; ;
"She had better stay there , Lucy thought ; ;"
"Well , Lucy ? ?"
She had a day of things to do ; ;
How long would it be occupied ? ?
"She wondered , with a baffled feeling of helplessness ."
As long as the unscrupulous Myra chose ? ?
"`` Websterville Junction calling '' , she said ."
`` I just thought I'd let you know .
I'd have phoned sooner but I've been busy '' .
`` I can imagine '' ! !
Susan was an active character ; ;
Lucy drew out the chair and sat down ; ;
`` How was Cathy '' ? ?
`` Subdued .
"Puzzled , Lucy stared at the flowered wallpaper ; ;"
her mother was forthright ; ;
she was not usually given to mysterious silences .
"Shocked speechless , Lucy sat there ."
`` Christmastime ! !
it was only too true .
`` That does it '' ! !
She said .
`` I'll keep Cathy for two weeks .
Her hand tightened on the receiver .
Cowbird Myra ! !
She's not going to get away with it .
The child's thin legs were plodding .
"Unlike Susan , she was traveling light ; ;"
they would have to buy things for her .
She opened the door .
"Unimpressed , the dog plopped on the sand ."
Quint couldn't blame Maggie for disbelieving .
The swirling sand made Quint's limp more pronounced .
Now they were in friendly territory .
Nobody around .
Here he was enclosed and safe .
)
He was Canute controlling the waves .
Fearless .
He hadn't intended to make the promise .
It's all right .
Stop shaking '' .
`` Let's talk about the beach .
Son .
Dr. Fortman says swimming would help your leg .
`` How does he know ? ?
Big dumb nut .
He never had polio '' .
"`` You just wait , Dad ."
"Wait and see , Dad '' ."
He called her `` Fatso '' .
`` She's got a nerve '' .
Quint said now to the clouds .
Strength began to zip up and down his chest .
He felt strong as a giant .
"`` Aw , shut up '' , he said ."
I can't go in .
I'm scared of the nightmare .
"Shivering , he put on his clothes ."
She smelled of peppermints .
`` Why didn't you duck '' ? ?
He snapped .
`` This is my rock '' .
`` Isn't '' .
`` Is '' .
`` Isn't '' .
`` Is '' .
She was sore as a boil .
`` Ever hear of squatter's rights '' ? ?
`` Sure .
They started with the Kansas-Nebraska Bill of eighteen '' --
"`` Mister Big Britches , aren't you '' ? ?"
`` I'm Mark Gordon Peters the Fifth .
They call me Quint '' .
`` Then why don't you stop squinting '' ? ?
`` I said Quint .
That's short for Quintus .
Quintus in Latin means '' --
Her cough sounded like cloth ripping .
`` I don't smoke '' .
She was horrified .
`` Do you '' ? ?
"`` Hell , yes '' ."
"`` Sometimes eleven , fourteen a day '' ."
`` My mother never wops me .
I've got this leg brace '' .
"`` Dingy-looking '' , was what she said ."
She spouted a mouthful of water into the air .
`` A cane's mighty handy .
"Hey , will you look at that '' ? ?"
`` That's some dog .
What kind '' ? ?
"`` Part collie , part wire-haired terrier '' ."
Quint glared .
He always did when people asked .
He's braver than he looks .
He's been sick lately .
Last Tuesday he went on a ham jag '' .
`` A what '' ? ?
That meant `` Mama wants you Quint .
Come home or I'll come find you '' .
`` I gotta go .
I come early in the morning '' .
`` So do I .
"See you around , Mister Squint '' ."
That was how they started being friends .
They met next morning and all the mornings thereafter .
it made her blister .
`` You going to marry the King '' ? ?
`` No .
My hair is what he's nuts about .
Naturally curly hair runs in my family .
`` Which continent '' ? ?
"`` Name one , I been there '' ."
Pugh .
Camels in Tripoli had harelips .
`` Really '' .
Quint smothered a yawn .
`` Books are for schnooks '' .
Nobody ever appreciated his jokes as much as Sabella .
Tooth-hurty '' .
That dog has to go '' .
He hadn't .
`` Either that or a veterinarian '' .
`` You can't serve cod and salmon '' .
Sometimes they argued .
His encylopedia agreed with Sabella .
"Boy , could she catch ! !"
Like Willie Mays in the outfield .
`` Nobody gave me flowers before .
"Thank you , Quint '' ."
Sometimes they didn't talk at all .
Wednesday morning it happened .
They were eating breakfast .
Fifteen days early -- isn't that wonderful '' ? ?
"`` Yeah , keen '' ."
A cave seemed to be opening in Quint's stomach .
"`` Children , we'll have to get organized ."
The baby can have an early nap .
"Victoria , I want you to -- ''"
The cave in his stomach hurt .
He had to go into the water .
He'd tell Sabella about the nightmare .
"What caused it , he didn't know ."
The metal collar gagging his neck ? ?
Sweating so much ? ?
The unbearable weight on his chest ? ?
All of it together meant drowning .
And romantic ? ?
`` Poor John '' ! !
You saw them always together those years .
You talked about John-and-Linda as an entity .
John-and-Linda were at Longue Vue last night ; ;
only this one didn't heal .
It got worse instead of better .
And then there was Linda's engagement to Bobbie Evans .
It wasn't even John and Edythe .
It was simply Poor John .
Bobbie and Linda looked magnificent at their wedding .
John was at the church with Edythe .
`` Poor John '' ! !
There were less-dramatic reasons too .
John was good at his job .
Everyone held his or her breath .
Poor John '' .
She knew what people were thinking ; ;
it was what she had been thinking herself .
she could be sure of that .
"Linda would have to wait , she knew ."
"Of course , he had done wonders ."
`` What did you do '' ? ?
She asked Bobbie .
"`` You must have done something , something wrong ."
Lord knows I had everything set for you '' .
Most of the directors nodded .
Uncle Donald Murkland found himself nodding agreement too .
Poor John's rise continued to be meteoric .
`` Shirley appreciated the chance to make some money .
"`` That's swell '' , I said sweetly ."
I could get along without that three dollars .
I answered to find Nadine at the other end .
`` What's wrong '' ? ?
Her voice came shrill .
`` I'm absolutely frantic ! !
`` I can't leave the party ! !
I was all set for what came next .
I'll call you there in ten minutes '' --
"`` Fifteen minutes , then ! !"
"Please , Janice ."
I'll be glad to pay you '' --
So sure that money could do anything ! !
"`` All right '' , I said ."
I'd do it .
Her face was flushed from sleep .
She didn't look over thirteen .
And Nadine insisted that her sitters be reliable ! !
The phone started ringing .
"`` That's Mrs. Roberts again '' , I said ."
`` I'll answer it '' .
"`` Janice , would you mind staying '' ? ?"
The receiver clicked in my ear .
She didn't even give me a chance to refuse .
I had always thought she was so beautiful .
But now she looked ugly .
"`` Pack your clothes '' , she hissed ."
`` Pack -- and get out '' ! !
"`` You're crazy '' , Wally said thickly ."
He insulted Ken Thom '' ! !
Her eyes were wild .
And the other people there were listening ! !
I was plenty scared .
"`` Tea , '' Nadine screeched ."
`` How can you be so damn stupid ? ?
Wally's lost his job ! !
Ken will never forgive him -- never ! !
`` Stop that ! !
You'll wake up the whole building .
Wally can't go any place at this hour '' --
Wally was snoring on the davenport .
I had done all I could .
I had done all I was going to do .
"I drove home , found Chris still asleep ."
Thankful I wasn't Nadine .
I kept on being thankful .
But she was beyond caring what she said .
Now maybe they'd realize that life can be tough .
"When A bubble breaks , there's nothing ."
Chris fretted .
"I said I wished we were , too ."
But Chris brightened up like a candle .
"`` I'm glad you feel that way , honey ."
There is one big way we can help them .
We can let them move in with us '' --
Something I had simply never thought of .
Something so incredible --
I just stared at him .
`` I know we'd be pretty crowded .
"Then I felt uncomfortable , too ."
"But , in the end , we did ."
Then Wally got sick .
"While I worked , Nadine sat and cried ."
You're just a no-good bum '' ! !
"It was a mess , all right ."
Wendell Thom had black-balled him .
Nobody would even take his application .
But this was only the middle of July .
And I couldn't take six more weeks of this .
I don't really believe in intuition .
"And for the thousandth time , I answered myself ."
I hadn't chosen medicine -- it had chosen me .
I had a lot to be thankful for .
Especially in the way Gladdy had turned out .
But I mustn't start on Alice .
Should I tell him the truth about Alice ? ?
"Two interns and Dick Ishii , the other resident ."
I wasn't surprised .
Alice But this woman's name was Rose Bancroft ! !
I looked at the chart for reassurance .
"Yes , Rose Bancroft , diagnosis : acute alcoholism ."
"Oh , could it be ? ?"
"In a low voice , Dick filled us in"
It was the old story .
`` Hey '' ! !
Her voice was flat and dull .
There were bloodspots on the sheet .
`` What's this '' ? ?
I asked .
`` Your period '' ? ?
She shook her head .
"Once again , there was a negative shake ."
I was busy the rest of the day .
"`` There's something there , all right ."
"Class Three , they said ."
"But that was ridiculous , of course ."
`` All right .
I grimaced in distaste .
What do you want '' ? ?
"That's quite minor , nothing to worry about ."
`` No '' .
"It was flat , definite ."
`` Suppose you let me explain .
`` No '' .
I looked at her in amazement .
`` Will you tell me why '' ? ?
I asked .
"She smiled , a smile without humor ."
"`` I've got cancer , haven't I '' ? ?"
"She went on , disregarding my protests ."
"Let your pupils learn on someone else , Doctor ."
Just let me die in peace '' .
"I stared at her , almost speechless ."
"A long , long way down ."
"Again there was something familiar about her , something --"
And even if '' --
I gaped at her .
"`` Surprised , baby ? ?"
"Guess I've changed , haven't I ? ?"
"But you haven't changed much , Joe '' ."
"I knew then , knew with a heart-stopping shock ."
`` Alice '' -- I stammered through dry lips .
"`` Alice , for goodness sake '' --"
"`` Alice '' , she echoed mockingly ."
"Well , don't worry ."
Just let me outta here '' --
`` But why did you come back '' ? ?
I'd found my voice .
She shrugged .
`` Here and there .
And this was Gladdy's mother ! !
Let me outta here ! !
"No , I want out , Joe '' ! !"
And Gladdy would be safe ! !
She made me welcome .
The reasons for this dive seemed foolish now .
Only the dive itself had any meaning .
"I chuckled aloud , and the mouthpiece fell out ."
I knew it wouldn't be the same .
I felt like a Hun in Rome .
everything was glamorous to my dazzled eyes .
I never got there .
"I met Claire , which was better ."
I stared .
I feel another of terrible urgency .
Is your evening free '' ? ?
And so off we went to her apartment .
I got there on a Saturday evening .
I went to my hotel and slept .
So I drank more cognac .
"Elemental , but sex ."
That's what was on my mind .
I felt better Tuesday evening when I woke up .
A good binge has that kind of therapeutic value .
I went out into it .
I was just miserable .
Suddenly I understood why she had the umbrella .
It gave her poise and posture .
Without it she would have been drab and limp .
It gave her propriety .
I couldn't imagine her without it .
I knew all about her .
( I didn't have on a hat .
)
`` Is it a woman '' ? ?
She asked gently .
''
I even snorted a chuckle .
She was even more miserable than me .
`` Now isn't it better to smile '' ? ?
She asked .
I could see she was shocked .
I wasn't going to lug around a glass .
I couldn't be sure .
Somehow she was attractive .
I sensed no stranger in her .
My head was clear .
"Maybe closer to thirty , I thought ."
`` Bon jour '' ! !
"She exclaimed , smiling ."
`` J'ai faim '' ! !
"`` Yeah , but breakfast first '' ."
With a laugh she beat me to the bathroom .
I gave it to the woman .
`` What is this for '' ? ?
She asked innocently .
"`` Why , to brush your teeth '' ."
`` But I already have ! !
I used yours '' .
`` Oh '' ? ?
I said with round eyes .
"As we ate , we talked ."
"Her name was Suzanne , and mine Stephen ."
`` Um '' ? ?
"I grunted , sipping ."
`` I carry one in my purse .
I know men never kiss les putains '' .
`` All right '' .
I said with enthusiasm at the idea .
`` But not immediately '' .
I put aside my empty cup .
We were not rushed .
`` What is this from '' ? ?
"I asked , touching the scar on her stomach ."
"`` A bullet '' , she answered ."
We had champagne and steamed mussels .
He must have thought I was a tourist .
I didn't ask for a Jeroboam of champagne '' .
There's nothing to stop me now .
In the street the traffic was really frightening .
The Spanish Steps .
Halfway up the staircase she stopped and sat down .
She loosened her tweed jacket and smoked a cigarette .
Content excited ; ;
how could you be both at once ? ?
"Strange , but she was ."
No return address whatsoever .
He was full of heavy family reminiscence .
Poor George ! !
"The only boy , the family darling ."
She kept repeating .
Can you think of anything to do '' ? ?
`` Drop a cold key down his back '' .
"`` Poor Cousin Elec '' , George said ."
`` Poor Cousin Elec '' .
Theresa shifted to a new page .
''
"`` No '' , said Theresa ."
"`` No , no '' ! !"
She said .
The man did not wish to leave .
"Was he ever successful , Theresa wondered ."
"at last , alarm ."
"Finally , she scurried away up the steps ."
`` Signora '' ? ?
"`` Mi diapiace , Signora , ma insomma ."
''
`` Oh put it there '' ! !
She indicated a spot a little distance away .
"Susan Dolan , that's me ."
I asked him if it was true .
"He gave me a straight , honest answer ."
"`` Look , Sue baby '' , he'd said ."
But it didn't seem fair .
He wasn't only different -- he was it .
I could hardly believe such good luck was mine .
I didn't like it one bit .
But what could I do ? ?
Neither was his wife .
"She wouldn't have , even if he'd asked her ."
Johnnie loved me and wanted me .
The rides were tame enough -- mostly we talked .
Somebody with no vices .
You know '' .
`` And you fall for a lumber jockey '' .
`` Who drinks far too much '' .
`` And smokes too much '' .
He examined his nails carefully .
`` I could walk out the door '' .
`` Don't you dare '' .
He still wasn't looking at me .
`` You wouldn't '' .
`` Or I could visit Lucille Warren '' .
`` You wouldn't .
Please ! !
You wouldn't '' .
He shrugged noncommittally .
`` I might '' .
And now he was seeing her .
He'd just admitted it to me .
I huddled miserably beside him in the truck .
It was all my doing -- his seeing her .
My very first time .
"I wanted him , with a terrifying fierceness ."
"`` Love me , Johnnie '' ."
"`` I will , kitten '' ! !"
`` Uh huh .
Always '' .
`` Mmm '' .
And I snuggled closer to the man I loved .
`` Johnnie ? ?
"`` It can't be wrong , can it ? ?"
Not really '' .
Johnnie rose on one elbow .
`` Stop worrying .
It's never wrong if love is real '' .
"Infinite peace , complete contentment ."
"Idiot's delight , I later discovered ."
"I was practically a bride , after all ."
"Of this , I had no doubt ."
Of course he would .
The cost didn't matter .
What could a mere twelve years matter ? ?
And hadn't I rescued him from Lucille Warren ? ?
`` Love me '' ? ?
`` Uh-huh .
Love you '' .
"`` Always and always , Johnnie '' ? ?"
`` Always '' .
`` Mmm '' .
Convention time in Boston .
I had mixed emotions about going .
So I went to Boston .
I couldn't help laughing with him .
"`` Alma , Schmalma ."
Come along with me '' .
I went .
"But that was only natural , I decided ; ;"
surely he was still resting snugly in my heart .
`` She's invisible tonight .
I drew back .
"`` I -- I don't think so , Ronald ."
Not for me '' .
"`` Aw , come on '' ."
`` No -- really '' .
He shrugged .
`` Okay .
The kitchen was jammed .
"Breakfast , he thought ."
Then he remembered .
"Share bath , maybe -- but share refrigerator ? ?"
And where was the thing ? ?
"`` Lots of sun , lots of rest ."
The red pills are a vitamin-and-iron compound .
This is a sleeping capsule .
Charlie had accepted the diagnosis without comment .
`` Three-day blow '' ! !
She bellowed triumphantly .
"`` I hope so '' , he said ."
`` I've got this cold .
Thought I'd bake it out in the sun '' .
`` Ah '' .
She studied him briefly .
`` You've got a peaked look .
Better get in out of the wet '' .
`` Would you mind wrapping your onion '' ? ?
Said this note .
`` The smell permeates everything '' ! !
He didn't want to encourage anything here ; ;
`` Ugh '' .
Take Vivian .
"Yes , take Vivian ."
Somebody had .
He mused aloud .
Eh '' ? ?
`` What's that you say '' ? ?
"`` Oh , nothing ."
Just glad the rain's stopped '' .
"`` Oh , yes ."
Just look at that sky .
Be a scorcher by afternoon '' .
`` I hope so .
I've got this cold '' .
`` So you said '' .
She scrutinized him .
"`` My , you're peaked ."
That pale kind's the worst '' .
"That pale kind , Charlie thought ."
Hardly an inviting description .
"But then , neither was peaked ."
`` He's that peaked kind '' .
Surely there was a better word .
Charlie looked in the mirror .
"Run-down , iron-poor ."
He looked more closely .
"Frail , feeble -- peaked ."
It gave him a good feeling .
`` M-m-m .
"Thanks '' , was her answer the next day ."
"`` I've got this cold '' , he wrote ."
Not that it was any of her business .
Why don't you try that '' ? ?
`` I don't have a lemon '' .
"`` Gee , neither do I '' ."
Charlie grinned .
She didn't sound like a pale girl .
She sounded a little like a redhead .
"But then , redheads are often pale ."
I haven't seen her on the beach '' .
She's got browny hair '' .
Hope you don't mind '' .
Sympathy is a fine quality in a woman .
Suppose what's-his-name got a sunburn ? ?
Charlie couldn't see Vivian offering any hand lotion .
Correspondence passed back and forth .
`` How's your sunburn now ? ?
`` That Mrs. Kirby ! !
How's your cold '' ? ?
`` Broiled out .
She didn't say you were puny .
Are you ? ?
What's puny '' ? ?
`` Puny goes with pale and peaked .
but the picture of Tom Swift is pretty sinister .
Also the canoe '' .
`` Third ! !
Third base '' ! !
Eddie shouted .
`` You bastard '' ! !
The Anniston catcher screamed .
The fighters were separated in a few minutes .
The game was resumed .
But Mike Deegan was boiling mad now .
"`` Keep your eyes open , sonny '' ! !"
Mike yelled to the catcher .
`` You're in for trouble '' .
The Anniston catcher did not reply with words .
He simply turned to Mike and smiled .
"So help me God , I'll get him '' ."
Phil shrugged .
Maybe the answer was in his eyes .
But Mike had no chance of being tagged .
The Anniston catcher was straddling home plate .
Both fell heavily to the ground .
Only Mike got to his feet .
They poured water over their catcher's face .
He did not move .
Then the manager called for a doctor .
"Mike Deegan was sitting on the bench , watching ."
He was followed by four of his men .
Mike sat quietly watching the manager come nearer .
Eddie Lee moved over to Mike Deegan's side .
No one said a word .
His face was flushed .
`` That was a rotten thing to do '' .
"`` Stop it , will you ? ?"
Tell your guys not to block the plate '' .
`` You didn't have to ram him '' .
`` That's what you say '' .
The Anniston manager looked at Eddie Lee .
It was a cold and calculated look .
He arose slowly and brushed himself off .
`` Hit the bum '' ! !
Somebody yelled from the Anniston bench .
`` Look at those bastards '' ! !
"Charlie Haydon , a pitcher , said ."
`` They're looking for trouble '' .
Mike was slow getting into the box this time .
`` Listen '' ! !
He shouted to the pitcher .
`` I'll be waiting '' ! !
The pitcher yelled back .
"They were both walking towards each other , unhurried ."
Riverside and Anniston players rushed out on the field .
There was much shouting and screaming .
Fights sprang up and were quickly squelched .
Frankie Ricco sat down on the bench near Phil .
The other players were undressing quietly .
Eddie Lee had not come in yet .
Mike went over to Phil and stood over him .
`` I didn't think it was necessary '' .
`` Well ! !
Now that's just fine ! !
You didn't think it was necessary '' .
Mike placed both his hands on his hips .
He pushed his jaw forward .
"`` Nobody else did , either '' ."
`` I'm not trying to say anything '' .
He sat down before Eddie's desk .
Phil's eyes widened just a trifle .
You don't belong in professional baseball '' .
Phil had to clear his throat .
"`` No '' , Eddie said ."
Phil stood up .
`` Listen ! !
This is the second time .
''
`` I'm not saying you're yellow .
I am saying you're not a professional ballplayer '' .
Eddie Lee leaned forward over the desk .
"`` Now listen to me , Phil ."
I'm not steering you wrong .
You haven't got the heart for baseball '' .
Phil shook his head and Eddie frowned .
Suddenly his voice grew hard .
I know you've got talent .
"The heart , Phil ."
My batting average ''
`` What difference does your batting average make ? ?
Or your fielding average .
Or even the way you run bases .
Baseball's no cinch .
What the hell do you think baseball is ? ?
A sport ? ?
"It's a way of life , goddamit ! !"
He's wrong ! !
Phil thought .
It's only his opinion .
There were other clubs in this league .
He stood up slowly .
He was a little pale and shaky .
His lips felt glued together .
Eddie nodded .
`` Okay .
You'll get your pay in the morning '' .
Phil shut the door behind him .
`` What happened '' ? ?
Frankie asked .
Phil said : `` I got my release '' .
`` You crazy '' ? ?
Phil shrugged .
`` What for '' ? ?
Phil sighed .
Frankie shook his head .
`` I don't get it '' .
"`` I don't know '' , Phil said ."
They were silent for a few moments .
Phil took off one shoe and stared at it .
The leagues are full of guys like that '' .
Phil was very quiet .
Phil did not answer .
`` Why not try another club '' ? ?
Phil looked up .
"`` Springfield's in tomorrow '' , Frankie said ."
`` Talk to Whitey Jackson '' .
"`` Will you do it , Phil '' ? ?"
`` Do what '' ? ?
`` Ask Whitey for a job '' .
Phil nodded .
"`` Sure '' , he said ."
`` Springfield come in tomorrow '' ? ?
Frankie nodded .
`` I'll speak to Whitey '' .
`` Atta boy '' .
"`` I'll talk to him , all right '' ."
"`` Don't worry '' , Frankie said ."
`` You'll get a job there .
He needs outfielders bad '' .
`` That's the way to talk .
What else did Eddie have to say '' ? ?
"`` Nothing '' , Phil said ."
Richard's next interest seemed the product of his insularity .
`` Did you think there were two '' ? ?
Grinned his father .
"`` You don't understand '' , Richard said gloomily ."
The week at home was not comfortable .
Have you ever been to Ryusenji '' ? ?
No one had .
I was thoroughly startled '' .
Sushi was Out because it was pretentious .
`` Did you watch him '' ? ?
Asked a red-haired girl named Ceecee Witter .
"`` For a minute , anyhow ."
I'm surprised no one has been there .
I've been there a number of times .
"Sam , I thought you knew everything about Tokyo ."
You've never been to Ryusenji '' ? ?
"Oh , that's what I meant to tell you ."
`` Twenty-two or twenty-three '' .
It would kill one of us '' .
It was true ; ;
The conversation went on but Richard stopped listening .
He walked all the miles back to his room .
You are much too beautiful .
I saw it all at a glance .
It was no use .
I felt the anger mount within me .
I knew the boy well .
`` Can I ride around with you '' ? ?
"I pointed to the splintered , upright stake ."
`` Did you do that '' ? ?
I asked .
`` I killed a snake ; ;
it was a big one '' .
He tried to take my hand to show me .
`` Why did you kill it '' ? ?
`` Snakes are ugly and bad '' .
`` This snake was very beautiful .
Didn't you see how beautiful it was '' ? ?
"`` Snakes are ugly '' , he said again ."
This snake could not harm anything '' .
"`` You are talking foolishly '' , I said ."
`` Nobody likes snakes '' .
The fire of the colors was gone ; ;
there was a contorted ugliness now ; ;
He said .
I said .
`` Don't you see the difference now '' ? ?
"`` Don't '' , I said ."
I could have slapped the boy .
Cady Partlow lit his pipe with no comfort .
This was it .
He wondered if he had played it wrong .
Maybe he should have kept in touch .
Gone back for reunions .
"Besides , Cady Partlow knew he wasn't the old-grad-type ."
It wouldn't help anyway .
Pete's son was rejected .
Imagine his son being that good in science ! !
"But then , he hadn't studied very hard ."
He put down his pipe and started to type .
"Height , 6' ."
"Weight , 160 ."
"Health , excellent ."
"Just give him time , give him a chance ."
"There , that did it ."
He shoved the unsealed letter into his coat pocket .
Anne had a way with words .
A woman had it or she didn't .
Anne had it .
She said what she meant and let it be .
She never got on his back .
He could take the advice or leave it .
`` I was just thinking how things have changed .
Be our guest ! !
It's our pleasure ! !
Tom slid open the door to the lobby .
"`` That's a fact , Mr. Partlow ."
`` Going to State '' ? ?
`` No .
Always messing around with science stuff .
"Real bright along those lines , you might say ."
He got a science scholarship to Yale '' .
Just fine '' .
They had all turned down his son .
Weakness in leadership .
So sorry .
Limited interests .
So sorry .
No clear motivation .
So sorry .
He liked looking at Anne .
Most people did .
"`` Board meeting tonight , Cady '' ? ?"
"`` No , I begged off ."
Work to do '' .
Let's forget the rules '' .
David grinned .
"`` I'm sorry , Dave ."
The car ? ?
Of course you can have it '' .
Cady begged the question .
"`` Don't worry about it , Dave ."
Your acceptance will come through '' .
"`` Don't be too sure , Dad ."
Dave kissed her lightly .
Get my old man to bed early .
He looks a little bit frayed '' .
`` Let's go into the library .
You do seem somewhat tattered '' .
"`` Wrong word , darling ."
Need any help '' ? ?
"`` In a way , yes ."
Hanford College hasn't decided on Dave's application yet .
Here's what I wrote '' .
Already he could feel Anne's questioning eyes .
`` But he was president '' .
Cady stuck his jaw out .
`` The fact remains he was treasurer '' .
`` And the swimming team .
"No , Cady , he made second team ."
Just missed the first '' .
`` Anything else '' ? ?
"`` Yes '' , she said quietly ."
It isn't like you .
David's interests .
Astronomy .
Those aren't his interests now '' .
`` What do you suggest '' ? ?
`` Music ! !
Anne smiled .
`` You mean that rock-and-roll combo ? ?
"He's -- he's just there , that's all '' ."
"`` Yes , he's just there ."
He keeps the beat going .
He doesn't like to rise and shine .
Cady appeared slightly mollified .
`` All right .
Anne folded the worrisome document .
He hasn't used it now for several years .
Just what '' ? ?
`` It's Dave who is applying to Hanford College .
Why don't you ask him '' ? ?
Cady put the well-worn chip back on his shoulder .
`` Dave has qualities of leadership .
He just hasn't developed them yet .
Give him time '' .
"He never will , Cady ."
All your wishful thinking won't change that .
The pair of white cotton shorts ruled his life .
He had always been a messy and negligent man .
No doubt Dolores resented following in their footsteps .
"But , to put it bluntly , nothing snapped ."
They married .
More he could take at leisure .
They had left themselves too much to discover .
Good .
) that he dropped the shorts on the floor .
Martin gave her a teasing pat .
It was almost too easy .
He was wrong .
Quietly he determined to foil her .
my nerves are as strong .
She'll rush to the bedroom when the doorbell rings .
It rang .
Ten minutes early .
Dolores stood motionless in the doorway .
Martin turned his back .
He strode to answer the bell .
Bill's hat was deposited in the hall closet .
Martin strained his ears .
At first he could not be sure .
A glissade of giggles slid over their voices .
The Brainards went home early .
As violently as possible .
And if he surrendered after raving at her .
He shivered .
Suppose he ran up the white flag altogether ? ?
At once .
He considered the sober possibility .
The battle had to be fought .
Let the best sex win .
But his resolution hardly seemed to help .
It was curious how the different visitors took this .
Others asked .
Quite a few laughed .
While he waited in the living room .
Once Martin went along .
"They entered the bedroom , and Dolores said nothing ."
Then one of the guests showed his merriment .
Martin would have liked to break the man's neck .
Dolores smiled ; ;
she let the interpretation stand .
They kept up a rigid pretense of speaking relations .
What to talk about ? ?
The shorts alone remained .
The sound of their amazement .
Bizarre : He could hear the word .
The most bizarre situation .
We were up to visit them and
He had thought her exactly what he wanted .
Everyone would know why ; ;
he would cut a supremely ridiculous figure .
He was trapped .
"His mind scurried frantically , seeking an exit ."
"Nothing would change , nothing would ever change ."
"Sooner or later , Dolores would crack ."
He sat down on the bed .
"In a surprisingly short time , Dolores appeared ."
"Well , Martin thought , That'll save ."
He left for work in high spirits .
"`` Good old A-Z '' , Cap said ."
Isn't his racket down your alley '' ? ?
"Once it was , William thought ."
But not any more .
At that point William came into the picture .
The conversion will cost a fortune .
Here are a few facts and figures I've assembled .
And Gerry .
Freddy is deeply committed to our plans already .
"`` Yes , I appreciate that ."
I wish you wouldn't tell Freddy I'm lukewarm ; ;
"`` Which is a frightful prospect , Bill '' ."
Willis laughed .
Let me think about it .
Stock Willis held in abundance fell sharply in value .
Once more Willis summoned William .
Freddy's solution doesn't appeal to me .
William spent a long week end closeted with Hamrick .
Then he caught fire .
I wish I was younger and less timid .
"Well , I can't resolve this myself ."
I'll have to call in the brain trust .
Are you willing to run the gantlet ? ?
I can't guarantee you a sympathetic audience '' .
He paused .
I hate that .
You're -- you're Arthur Willis .
Forgive the hearts and flowers theme '' .
`` Thank you '' .
"Move over , General Motors '' ."
`` You're leading Dad down the garden path '' .
"`` Your garden , God damn it '' ! !"
William said .
`` Nor crazy relatives .
We're here to transact business .
We've arrived at an age for romance and snobbery .
Look what those little European jobs are doing .
Financing emerged as the main obstacle .
"`` All right '' , William said ."
"If we can't raise the capital , we're through ."
Nothing has been lost .
You're up against it anyhow .
Why won't you give me a chance '' ? ?
A silence fell .
Heads instinctively turned in Willis' direction .
Good luck to you '' .
Nobody else showed pleasure .
`` I'm afraid not '' .
Welch wanted to know why .
No one knew .
At first Barco was evasive and shifty .
Welch summoned jail officials to Barco's cell .
Barco was clearly a `` nut '' .
`` That worm a murderer ? ?
Ridiculous '' ! !
His manhood had been attacked .
He stiffened and rose to his feet .
He'd show them ! !
`` Is that so '' ? ?
He queried .
''
Orders were given to dig .
Nothing was found .
Welch was worried .
The police captain chortled .
Welch was on edge .
`` There's something here '' ! !
Said the digger .
Joking stopped and everyone gathered around .
Welch was wild with delight .
"Well , here it is ."
And here it was ! !
I sat and watched proceedings .
No .
I'm not saying it right .
"How about them , I thought ."
They were `` personalities '' .
"No , not Bermuda ."
Bermuda was not in style that year .
They had honeymooned in Rome ; ;
everyone was very high on Rome that year .
bright pinks and plaids and vivid stripes .
"No one could dislike them , I thought ."
even brand names .
I couldn't feel at home among them .
"Besides Francesca , there was Blanche ."
"But dear me , no ; ;"
not Blanche .
the pets were a couple of Siamese cats .
I couldn't tell one from the other .
One or two were writers of books ; ;
all were fellows of finite charm .
In deference to country-squirehood .
In real life .
I wouldn't have missed it for anything .
`` O ! !
Pioneers ! !
`` Bananas '' ! !
Jennie had shouted each time .
`` They're not dessert ! !
They're not even food .
)
I'm a stranger in paradise '' .
The litigation was costly and seemingly endless .
Traitor indeed ! !
Could it do otherwise ? ?
( But that is another story .
It almost always works out for the best .
)
He did not ! !
But it was small consolation .
( An actor must have discipline .
It was a disaster ! !
"In clothes , Letch simply did not project ."
He was laughed off the screen .
)
`` What is Letch interested in '' ? ?
It wasn't his fault that these things were so .
His dogs ? ?
Dogs did something to one's ego .
Or was the answer less metaphysical ? ?
Did older people work more slowly ? ?
There was no compulsion behind them .
It was five minutes after four .
"Thus committed , action might follow ."
"`` There '' , said Mr. Mills ."
`` That'll get you started .
Best not to get everything at once .
Add things as you find you need 'em '' .
He didn't even ask the cost of this collection .
He was glad .
In front of it would be his workbench .
After the pegboard there would be the paneling .
It all seemed rather hopeless .
He turned his attention to the workbench .
Perhaps that was the first thing to do .
Mr. Crombie poked at it gingerly with his foot .
After that everything should be simpler .
He went upstairs to phone Crumb .
To his amazement he reached him .
Mr. Crumb was laid up with a bad cold .
"No , he didn't know of any handyman-carpenter ."
There wasn't any such thing any more .
There was a fellow named Blatz over Smithtown way .
Mr. Blatz agreed that this would be pretty .
It all did look very efficient and shipshape .
There was no question of that .
I guess you know about that .
He followed Mr. Blatz up the cellar stairs .
Mr. Crombie watched his wife with an anxious expression .
Mr. Crombie couldn't remember his saying any such thing .
But the discussion was academic .
Ambiguity
You explain English by Greek '' .
`` Good '' ! !
Replied the Senator .
Classified ads are also chockfull of misrelated constructions .
"View takes in five counties , two bedrooms '' ."
`` Officials Meet on rubbish .
Many Shapes in bathtubs .
Son and Daughter of Local Couple Married '' .
We have complete facilities to accommodate 200 people '' .
Samples : He walked in upon her invitation .
She kissed him passionately upon his reappearance .
He kissed her back .
"Strangely enough , this always brought the house down ."
A conscientious girl became the secretary of a doctor .
The maid demurred .
The comic indefinite comprises an extensive class of comedy .
The girl nodded understandingly .
Where were you '' ? ?
Her woolly-minded parent agreed .
"`` Of course , dear '' , she said ."
And yet it is not .
It is but so-so '' .
He asked .
`` What have you got on today '' ? ?
She inquired .
"`` A blue suit '' , he answered ."
`` Who's in it '' ? ?
She continued .
"`` I am '' , he said ."
There was a short pause for reflection .
Two friends were talking .
My husband is in great pain .
A bee's place is in the hive '' .
Did you go to their funeral '' ? ?
"`` I was wrong '' , I admitted ."
"`` Comedy didn't die , it just went crazy ."
There are even publications called Sick and Mad .
it is manic as a man '' .
Do you want to hear the paraphrase '' ? ?
`` Can I bear it '' ? ?
Foreigners this way ' ! !
`` What's the matter with the music '' ? ?
Moreland asked .
"`` Let's talk about books '' , Moreland said ."
Is it all non-fiction '' ? ?
"Moreland asked , grimly ."
"`` Cryptic '' , I said ."
We sat for a while drinking in silence .
There was a long silence .
He asked .
`` Or perhaps a new Noel Coward '' ? ?
I myself hear it said constantly -- in drawing-rooms .
I stood up and began pacing .
"`` Furiouser and furiouser '' , I said ."
Borrowing a line from Don Marquis' Mehitabel .
then he turned to me .
"The rhinos would panic , screaming help ! !"
Moreland demanded .
"`` Non-God , no '' , I said ."
`` Such as '' ? ?
Moreland asked .
`` What a nasty fall was there '' ! !
I said .
He looked so comfortable being straight .
They wanted to touch the mystery .
He was very rude .
The policeman's eyes rather popped for a second ; ;
and they had told their mother about the tumbles .
and so they were consistently true to their principles .
`` Never mind .
`` What is it '' ? ?
They had protested that that wasn't any surprise .
`` This is a warm-up '' .
`` Is it anything like cooked-over oatmeal '' ? ?
Asked one of the children .
"`` Not the least bit '' , Arlene snapped ."
But not hard for very long .
Just long enough to make you feel important .
Their curiosity went happily out of bounds .
They both laughed and winked back .
And she would wink and throw kisses .
"This time , it was so grand ; ;"
they could tell exactly what it was .
It was General Burnside's horse running in a circle .
He's old '' .
Then there was the General kissing his wife .
They had to be told that one .
But not General Burnside .
He was the funniest man .
Or his horse .
It wasn't very funny .
and they did some somersaults .
"But that wasn't very funny , either ."
And Arlene showed them how to begin .
That helped a lot .
That helped a great deal .
They were a little late in getting home .
We couldn't help laughing .
and Arlene began tapping the kitchen door open .
That tap had a slight bangish quality .
Her upper lip lifted slightly .
She was biting into a small red radish ; ;
"It never worked , naturally ; ;"
but it made her look unusual .
`` It must be awfully good for them .
`` But do you know something curious '' ? ?
She added .
I have no notion why I reached .
And I found a radish .
Was it an omen ? ?
I thought for a second .
Arlene became indispensable ; ;
nobody could have told why .
But she was .
It was in the air .
A friend of my father's came to dinner .
But he was always persuaded out .
"The children loathed him , too ."
We had just sat down .
`` We have good times '' .
This happy bulletin convulsed Mr. Gorboduc .
`` You do '' ? ?
"He asked , between wheezes of laughter ."
He was forced to wipe his eyes .
Eh '' ? ?
"`` No '' , he said ."
`` We don't '' .
Mr. Gorboduc took a swig of his sherry .
He asked .
"`` We bump '' , one said ; ;"
"`` We grind , too '' , he said ."
My mother was beside herself with curiosity .
"`` Say that again '' , she pleaded ."
`` You what '' ? ?
She could see that Mr. Gorboduc was intrigued ; ;
the hostess in her took over .
She was rollickingly happy .
`` You what '' ? ?
My uncle looked at Mr. Gorboduc .
Mr. Gorboduc looked down .
He would not look up .
He was very funny about the whole thing .
We caught the early train to New York .
"Petite , lovely Yvette Chadroe plays the nymphomaniac engagingly ."
Far from it ; ;
Hold on tight .
'fess up -- don't you ? ?
Very peculiar retribution indeed seems to overtake such jokers .
Have you ever heard of Thuggee ? ?
Nuf sed .
"Sort of remorseless , isn't it ? ?"
"Still , there it is ."
His energy was prodigious ; ;
`` No divinity will hold still for that .
He's really asking for it '' .
And how right she was .
`` See that guy '' ? ?
The operator asked pityingly .
